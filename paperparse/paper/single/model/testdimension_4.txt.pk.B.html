<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1> Summarization is an open representation of representation, in diverse forms, from multiple dimensions, and through interactions in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> The basic interactions include selecting, citing and organizing representations according to requirement and motivation.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Texts have been the major means to reflect the evolution of human society.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> It is necessary to explore automatic summarization of texts expanding rapidly in cyberspace.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> However, existing approaches are empirical, mainly relying on statistics, structure and linguistic analysis while neglecting the nature of representation and understanding.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> This paper summarizes previous approaches and explores the fundamental theory and method for summarization from multiple dimensions.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> The core viewpoint is that summarization is carried out with various interactions involved in human, machine, and various representations including text, picture, and video.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> Writers and readers represent mainly through explicit or implicit citations.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> Studying the summarization of pictures, videos and graphs reaches a general summarization method.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> It is hard for automatic summarization systems to realize human-level summarization as it concerns the essential natural and social differences between human and the systems.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11> Putting summarization into a human-machine-nature symbiotic network is a way to make a breakthrough.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12> A significant progress of summarization research relies on an innovative summarization of philosophy, psychology, linguistics, cognitive science, neuroscience, physics, computer science, and artificial intelligence from multiple dimensions.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13> This work is an attempt to help broaden the scope of summarization research and inspire cross-disciplinary research to develop this area.</a>
