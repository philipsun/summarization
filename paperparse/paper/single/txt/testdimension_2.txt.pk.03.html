     <a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>From this point of view, summarization can be regarded as a transformation of reducing the dimensions of a representation so that the dimensions of representation can be linked to and merge with the dimensions in the mental space.</a>

     <a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The suitable summarizer for summarizing a representation is rendered by the social network of its writers and readers.</a>

     <a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>5) The representation of knowledge is not unique, and the understanding of representation is not unique.</a>

     <a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The semantic link network can be regarded as the map of the cyberspace and social space.</a>

     <a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The reasonable method is to study the multiple dimensions of the summarization environment and to consider the reasonable result.</a>

     <a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Citations form the intention and extension of a representation.</a>

     <a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The union of the semantic link network and the classification space forms a complex classification space used to represent and organize semantic images.</a>

     <a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It is necessary to review previous efforts and explore the foundation of summarization.</a>

     <a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Exploring citation is a way to explore the nature of summarization.</a>

     <a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>e) Construct a semantic link network of pictures, tags and language representations in relevant texts as the summary.</a>

     <a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The knowledge provides the rules of representation and understanding.</a>

     <a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The basic characteristics and principles of language use and understanding indicate the following dimensions for evaluating a summarization.</a>

     <a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>One semantic link network of texts can link to the other semantic link networks of texts to form a larger semantic link network through such relations as citation and coauthor.</a>

     <a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Figure 8 depicts the idea of constructing a semantic link network of pictures and tags as a summary.</a>
