<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A summarization system consisting of a multi-dimensional classification space of summary in form of semantic link network of pictures and language representations and a requirement space defined and managed by users.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The form of summary can be a semantic link network of texts, pictures, audios, and videos.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>One semantic link network of texts can link to the other semantic link networks of texts to form a larger semantic link network through such relations as citation and coauthor.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The union of the semantic link network and the classification space forms a complex classification space used to represent and organize semantic images.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>summary should use the core representations in the original representation.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The intention of representation is indicated by core representations and by citation from other representations.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The representation that has a direct link to the core representation is close-core representation.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A solution is to establish the semantic links between pictures, discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, select one picture to represent one community, and construct a network of the representative pictures.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>A semantic link network of important concepts and relations can help readers quickly know the main cues and measures in representations.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The core representation renders the core idea of a representation.</a>
