<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The summarization S of a set of representations P is rendered by its intention Int(P) and extension Ext(B) as follows, where S(Int(P)) is the summarization of the intention of P, S(Int(P) Ext(P)) is the summarization of the intention and extension of P, p p means that p cites p , {Cite(pi p i [1, , m]} denotes the set of cite representations in pi that cites p, and Cite(pi p) describes p from the view of the author of pi.</a>
