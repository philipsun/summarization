<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The core representations in one representation (e.g.,, text) render its topic.</a>

<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>One semantic link network of texts can link to the other semantic link networks of texts to form a larger semantic link network through such relations as citation and coauthor.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The representation that has a direct link to the core representation is close-core representation.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>If we regard a text as a graph of words or sentences, text summarization can be regarded as a problem of summarizing a semantic link network [Zhuge, 2009], where nodes and edges can be texts, pictures and videos.</a>

<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The general summarization inputs a representation and a cognitive level at certain ontology and then outputs a representation lattice and a recommended representation.</a>
