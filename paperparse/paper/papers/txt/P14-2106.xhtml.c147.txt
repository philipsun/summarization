 This work has tried to shed light on the contribution of semantic information to dependency parsing. The experiments were thorough, testing two treebank conversions and three parsing paradigms on automatically predicted POS tags. Compared to [] , which used MaltParser on the LTH conversion and gold POS tags, our results can be seen as a negative outcome, as the improvements are very small and non-significant in most of the cases. For parser combination, WordNet semantic file information does give a small significant increment in the more fine-grained LTH representation. In addition we show that the improvement of automatic clusters is also weak. For the future, we think tdifferent parsers, eitherhat a more elaborate scheme is needed for word classes, requiring to explore different levels of generalization in the WordNet (or alternative) hierarchies.
