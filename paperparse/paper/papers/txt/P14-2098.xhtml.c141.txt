 A revision often contains multiple corrections that address different writing mistakes. We explore building computer programs to accurately detect individual corrections in one single revision. One major challenge lies in determining whether consecutive basic-edits address the same mistake. We propose a classifier specialized in this task. Our experiments suggest that: (1) the proposed classifier reduces correction mis-detections in previous systems by 1/3, leading to significant overall system performance. (2) our method is generalizable over different data collections.
