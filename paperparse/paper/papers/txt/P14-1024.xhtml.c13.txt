 The key contribution of our work is that we show how to identify metaphors across languages by building a model in English and applying it u'\u2014' without adaptation u'\u2014' to other languages: Spanish, Farsi, and Russian. This model uses language-independent (rather than lexical or language specific) conceptual features. Not only do we establish benchmarks for Spanish, Farsi, and Russian, but we also achieve state-of-the-art performance in English. In addition, we present a comparison of relative contributions of several types of features. We concentrate on metaphors in the context of two kinds of syntactic relations: subject-verb-object (SVO) relations and adjective-noun (AN) relations, which account for a majority of all metaphorical phrases. Future work will expand the scope of metaphor identification by including nominal metaphoric relations as well as explore techniques for incorporating contextual features, which can play a key role in identifying certain kinds of metaphors. Second, cross-lingual model transfer can be improved with more careful cross-lingual feature projection.
