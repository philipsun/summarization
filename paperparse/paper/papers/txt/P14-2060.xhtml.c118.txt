 In this paper we have presented methods for high precision abbreviation expansion for a TTS application. The methods are largely self-organizing, using in-domain unannotated data, and depend on only a small amount of annotated data. Since the SVM features relate to general properties of abbreviations, expansions and contexts, the classifier parameters will likely carry over to new (English) domains. We demonstrate that in combination with a hand-built TTS baseline, the methods afford dramatic improvement in the TP rate (to about 74% from a starting point of about 40%) and a reduction of FP to below our goal of 2%.
