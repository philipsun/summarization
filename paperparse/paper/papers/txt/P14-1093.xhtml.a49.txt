 We propose a supervised method of extracting event causalities like conduct slash-and-burn agriculture u'\u2192' exacerbate desertification from the web using semantic relation (between nouns), context, and association features. Experiments show that our method outperforms baselines that are based on state-of-the-art methods. We also propose methods of generating future scenarios like conduct slash-and-burn agriculture u'\u2192' exacerbate desertification u'\u2192' increase Asian dust (from China) u'\u2192' asthma gets worse . Experiments show that we can generate 50,000 scenarios with 68% precision. We also generated a scenario deforestation continues u'\u2192' global warming worsens u'\u2192' sea temperatures rise u'\u2192' vibrio parahaemolyticus fouls (water) , which is written in no document in our input web corpus crawled in 2007. But the vibrio risk due to global warming was observed in Baker-Austin et al. ( 2013 ) . Thus, we u'\u201c' predicted u'\u201d' the future event sequence in a sense.
