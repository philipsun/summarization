 In this paper, we presented multiple approaches for advanced Twitter sentiment analysis. We established a state-of-the-art baseline that utilizes a variety of features, and built a topic-based sentiment mixture model with topic-specific Twitter data, all integrated in a semi-supervised training framework. The proposed model outperforms the top system in SemEval-2013. Further research is needed to continue to improve the accuracy in this difficult domain.
