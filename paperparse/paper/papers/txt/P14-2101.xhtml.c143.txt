 In this paper we proposed a novel alternative to topic labelling which do not rely on external data sources. To the best of out knowledge no existing work has been formally studied for automatic labelling through summarisation. This experiment shows that existing summarisation techniques can be exploited to provide a better label of a topic, extending in this way a topic u'\u2019' s information by providing a richer context than top-terms. These results show that there is room to further improve upon existing summarisation techniques to cater for generating candidate labels.
