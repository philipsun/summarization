 In this paper we propose a new method of cross-lingual model transfer, report initial evaluation results and highlight directions for its further development. We observe that the performance of this method is competitive with that of established cross-lingual transfer approaches and its application requires very little manual adjustment u'\u2013' no heuristics or filtering and no explicit shared feature representation design. It also retains compatibility with any refinement procedures similar to projected transfer [] that may have been designed to work in conjunction with direct model transfer.
