 We presented DepecheMood , an emotion lexicon built in a novel and totally automated way by harvesting crowd-sourced affective annotation from a social news network. Our experimental results indicate high-coverage and high-precision of the lexicon, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches even when using the resource with very na√Øve classification and regression strategies. We believe that the wealth of information provided by social media can be harnessed to build models and resources for emotion recognition from text, going a step beyond sentiment analysis. Our future work will include testing Singular Value Decomposition on the word-by-document matrices, allowing to propagate emotions values for a document to similar words non present in the document itself, and the study of perceived mood effects on virality indices and readers engagement by exploiting tweets, likes, reshares and comments. 3 3 footnotetext: This work has been partially supported by the Trento RISE PerTe project.
