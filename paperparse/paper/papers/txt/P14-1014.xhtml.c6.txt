 We built a web-domain POS tagger using a two-phase approach. We used a WRRBM to learn the representation of the web text and incorporate the representation in a neural network, which is trained using guided learning for easy-first POS tagging. Experiment showed that our approach achieved significant improvement in tagging the web domain text. In addition, we found that keeping the learned representations unchanged yields better performance compared with further optimizing them on the source domain data. We release our tools at https://github.com/majineu/TWeb. For future work, we would like to investigate the two-phase approach to more challenging tasks, such as web domain syntactic parsing. We believe that high-accuracy web domain taggers and parsers would benefit a wide range of downstream tasks such as machine translation.
