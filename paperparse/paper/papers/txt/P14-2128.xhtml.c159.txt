 In this work, we proposed to treat punctuations as properties of context words for dependency parsing. Experiments with an arc-standard parser showed that our method effectively improves parsing performance and we achieved the best accuracy for single-model transition-based parser. Regarding punctuation processing for dependency parsing, Li et al. ( 2010 ) proposed to utilize punctuations to segment sentences into small fragments and then parse the fragments separately. A similar approach is proposed by Spitkovsky et al. ( 2011 ) which also designed a set of constraints on the fragments to improve unsupervised dependency parsing.
