 Our primary contribution consists of new modeling ideas, and associated inference techniques, for the problem of cross-document coreference resolution. We have described how writers systematically plunder ( u'\u03a6' ) and then systematically modify ( u'\ud835' u'\udf3d' ) the work of past writers. Inference under such models could also play a role in tracking evolving memes and social influence, not merely in establishing strict coreference. Our model also provides an alternative to the distance-dependent CRP. 3 Our implementation is available for research use at: https://bitbucket.org/noandrews/phyloinf .
