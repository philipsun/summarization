 In this paper, we proposed two polynomial time decoding algorithms using joint inference for sentence compression. The first one is an exact dynamic programming algorithm, and requires O u'\u2062' ( n 6 ) running time. This one does not show significant advantage in speed over ILP. The second one is an approximation of the first algorithm. It adopts Lagrangian relaxation to eliminate the compression ratio constraint, yielding lower time complexity T u'\u2062' O u'\u2062' ( n 4 ) . In practice it achieves nearly the same accuracy as the exact one, but is much faster. 3 3 Our code is available at http://code.google.com/p/sent-compress/ The main assumption of our method is that the dependency parse tree is projective, which is not true for some other languages. In that case, our method is invalid, but [ 17 ] still works. In the future, we will study the non-projective cases based on the recent parsing techniques for 1-endpoint-crossing trees [ 14 ] .
