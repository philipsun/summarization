 The novelty of this paper is a computational analysis of the relationship between the edit history and the discussion of a Wikipedia article. As far as we are aware, this is the first study to automatically analyze this relationship involving the textual content of edits and turns. Based on the types of turn and edit in an edit-turn-pair, we have operationalized the notion of corresponding and non-corresponding edit-turn-pairs. The basic assumption is that in a corresponding pair, the turn contains an explicit performative and the edit corresponds to this performative. We have presented a machine learning system to automatically detect corresponding edit-turn-pairs. To test this system, we manually annotated a corpus of corresponding and non-corresponding edit-turn-pairs. Trained and tested on this data, our system shows a significant improvement over the baseline. With regard to future work, an extension of the manually annotated corpus is the most important issue. Our classifier can be used to bootstrap the annotation of additional edit-turn-pairs.
