 We have proposed STRUCT, a general-purpose natural language generation system which is comparable to current state-of-the-art generators. STRUCT formalizes the generation problem as an MDP and applies a version of the UCT algorithm, a fast online MDP planner, to solve it. Thus, STRUCT naturally handles probabilistic grammars. We demonstrate empirically that STRUCT is anytime, comparable to existing generation-as-planning systems in certain NLG tasks, and is also capable of handling other, more complex tasks such as negated communicative goals. Though STRUCT has many interesting properties, many directions for exploration remain. Among other things, it would be desirable to integrate STRUCT with discourse planning and dialog systems. Fortunately, reinforcement learning has already been investigated in such contexts [ 13 ] , indicating that an MDP-based generation procedure could be a natural fit in more complex generation systems. This is a primary direction for future work. A second direction is that, due to the nature of the approach, STRUCT is highly amenable to parallelization. None of the experiments reported here use parallelization, however, to be fair to CRISP. We plan to parallelize STRUCT in future work, to take advantage of current multicore architectures. This should obviously further reduce generation time. STRUCT is open source and available from github.com upon request.
