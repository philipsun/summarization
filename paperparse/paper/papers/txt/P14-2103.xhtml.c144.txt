 We described an unsupervised graph-based method to associate textual labels with automatically generated topics. Our approach uses results retrieved from a search engine using the topic keywords as a query. A graph is generated from the words contained in the search results metadata and candidate labels ranked using the PageRank algorithm. Evaluation on a standard data set shows that our method consistently outperforms the supervised state-of-the-art method for the task.
