 We propose a novel abstractive query-based summarization system for conversations, where queries are defined as phrases reflecting a user information needs. We rank and extract the utterances in a conversation based on the overall content and the phrasal query information. We cluster the selected sentences based on their lexical similarity and aggregate the sentences in each cluster by means of a word graph model. We propose a ranking strategy to select the best path in the constructed graph as a query-based abstract sentence for each cluster. A resulting summary consists of abstractive sentences representing the phrasal query information and the overall content of the conversation. Automatic and manual evaluation results over meeting, chat and email conversations show that our approach significantly outperforms baselines and previous extractive models. Our phrasal query abstraction framework generates a grammatical abstract from a conversation following three steps, as shown in Figure 1. In this phase, our goal is to generate understandable informative abstract sentences that capture the content of the source sentences and represents the information needs defined by queries. There are several ways of generating abstract sentences (e.g. [ 2 , 18 , 8 , 23 ] ); however, most of them rely heavily on the sentence structure. We believe that such approaches are suboptimal, especially in dealing with conversational data, because multiparty written conversations are often poorly structured. Instead, we apply an approach that does not rely on syntax, nor on a standard NLG architecture. Moreover, since dealing with user queries efficiency is an important aspect, we aim for an approach that is also motivated by the speed with which the abstracts are obtained. We perform the task of abstract generation in three steps, as follows:
