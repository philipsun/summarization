 Robust citation classification has been hindered by the relative lack of annotated data. In this paper we successfully use a large, out-of-domain, annotated corpus to improve the citation polarity classification. Our approach uses a deep learning neural network for domain adaptation with labeled out-of-domain data and unlabeled in-domain data. This semi-supervised domain adaptation approach outperforms the in-domain citation polarity classification and other fully supervised domain adaptation approaches. Acknowledgments.
