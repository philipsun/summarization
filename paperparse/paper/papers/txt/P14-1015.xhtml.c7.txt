 We considered the problem of unsupervised solution post identification from discussion forum threads. Towards identifying solutions to the problem posed in the initial post, we proposed the usage of a hitherto unexplored textual feature for the solution identification problem; that of lexical correlations between problems and solutions. We model and harness lexical correlations using translation models, in the company of unigram language models that are used to characterize reply posts, and formulate a clustering-based EM approach for solution identification. We show that our technique is able to effectively identify solutions using just one non-content based feature, the post position, whereas previous techniques in literature have depended heavily on structural features (that are not always available in many forums) and supervised information. Our technique is seen to outperform the sole unsupervised solution identification technique in literature, by a large margin; further, our method is even seen to be competitive to recent methods that use supervision, beating one of them comfortably, and trailing another by a narrow margin. In short, our empirical analysis illustrates the superior performance and establishes our method as the method of choice for unsupervised solution identification. Exploration into the usage of translation models to aid other operations in discussion forums such as proactive word suggestions for solution authoring would be interesting direction for follow-up work. Discovery of problem-solution pairs in cases where the problem post is not known beforehand, would be a challenging problem to address.
