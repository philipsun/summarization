 To date, the most successful constituency parsers have largely been generative, and operate by refining the grammar either manually or automatically so that relevant information is available locally to each parsing decision. Our main contribution is to show that there is an alternative to such annotation schemes: namely, conditioning on the input and firing features based on anchored spans. We build up a small set of feature templates as part of a discriminative constituency parser and outperform the Berkeley parser on a wide range of languages. Moreover, we show that our parser is adaptable to other tree-structured tasks such as sentiment analysis; we outperform the recent system of Socher et al. ( 2013 ) and obtain state of the art performance on their dataset. Our system is available as open-source at https://www.github.com/dlwh/epic .
