 We have presented a simple but effective approach to integrating the sentence skeleton information into a phrase-based system. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves very promising BLEU improvements and TER reductions on the NIST evaluation data. In our future work we plan to investigate methods of integrating both syntactic models (for skeleton translation) and phrasal models (for full translation) in our system. We also plan to study sophisticated reordering models for skeleton translation, rather than reusing the baseline reordering model which is learned on the full sentences.
