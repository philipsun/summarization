 In this paper, we explored an active learning approach to improve data annotation quality for classification tasks. Instead of training the active learner using computationally expensive techniques (e.g., SVM-TF), we used a novel non-linear distribution spreading algorithm. This algorithm first weighs the features using the Delta-IDF technique, and then non-linearly spreads out the distribution of the feature scores to enhance the model u'\u2019' s ability to discriminate at the feature level. The evaluation shows that our algorithm has the following advantages: (1) It intelligently ordered the data points for annotators to annotate the most likely errors first. The accuracy was at least comparable with computationally expensive baselines (e.g. SVM-TF). (2) The algorithm trained and ran much faster than SVM-TF, allowing annotators to finish more annotations than competitors. (3) The annotation process improved the dataset quality by positively impacting the accuracy of classifiers that were built upon it.
