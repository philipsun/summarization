 We have proposed an algorithm for using a two-step collaboration between non-professional translators and post-editors to obtain professional-quality translations. Our method, based on a co-ranking model, selects the best crowdsourced translation from a set of candidates, and is capable of selecting translations which near professional quality. Crowdsourcing can play a pivotal role in future efforts to create parallel translation datasets. In addition to its benefits of cost and scalability, crowdsourcing provides access to languages that currently fall outside the scope of statistical machine translation research. In future work on crowdsourced translation, further benefits in quality improvement and cost reduction could stem from 1) building ground truth data sets based on high-quality Turkers u'\u2019' translations and 2) identifying when sufficient data has been collected for a given input, to avoid soliciting unnecessary redundant translations.
