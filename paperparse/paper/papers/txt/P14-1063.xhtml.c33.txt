 In this paper, we reformulated the traditional linear vector-space models as tensor-space models, and proposed an online learning algorithm named Tensor-MIRA. A tensor-space model is a compact representation of data, and via rank-1 tensor approximation, the weight tensor can be made highly structured hence the number of parameters to be trained is significantly reduced. This can be regarded as a form of model regularization.Therefore, compared with the traditional vector-space models, learning in the tensor space is very effective when a large feature set is defined, but only small amount of training data is available. Our experimental results corroborated this argument. As mentioned in Section 3.2 , one interesting problem that merits further investigation is how to determine optimal mode sizes. The challenge of applying a tensor model comes from finding a proper tensor structure for a given problem, and the key to solving this problem is to find a balance between the model complexity (indicated by the order and sizes of modes) and the number of parameters. Developing a theoretically guaranteed approach of finding the optimal structure for a given task will make the tensor model not only perform well in low-resource environments, but adaptive to larger data sets.
