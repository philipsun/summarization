 This paper proposed a novel CWS model for the SMT task. This model aims to maintain the linguistic segmentation supervisions from treebank data and simultaneously integrate useful bilingual segmentations induced from the bitexts. This objective is accomplished by three main steps: 1) learn word boundaries from character-based alignments; 2) encode the learned word boundaries into a GP constraint; and 3) training a CRFs model, under the GP constraint, by using the PR framework. The empirical results indicate that the proposed model can yield better segmentations for SMT.
