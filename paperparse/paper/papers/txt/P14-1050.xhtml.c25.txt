 In order to extract new sentiment words from large-scale user-generated content, this paper proposes a fully unsupervised, purely data-driven, and almost knowledge-free (except POS tags) framework. We design statistical measures to quantify the utility of a lexical pattern and to measure the possibility of a word being a new word, respectively. The method is almost free of linguistic resources (except POS tags), and does not rely on elaborated linguistic rules. We conduct extensive experiments to reveal the influence of different statistical measures in new word finding. Comparative experiments show that our proposed method outperforms baselines remarkably. Experiments also demonstrate that inclusion of new sentiment words benefits sentiment classification definitely. From linguistic perspectives, our framework is capable to extract adjective new words because the lexical patterns usually modify adjective words. As future work, we are considering how to extract other types of new sentiment words, such as nounal new words that can express sentiment.
