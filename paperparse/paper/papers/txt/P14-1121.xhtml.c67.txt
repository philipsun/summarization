 In this paper, we have studied how an unbalanced specialized comparable corpus could influence the quality of the bilingual lexicon extraction. This aspect represents a significant interest when working with specialized comparable corpora for which the quantity of the data collected may differ depending on the languages involved, especially when involving the English language as many scientific documents are available. More precisely, our different experiments show that using an unbalanced specialized comparable corpus always improves the quality of word translations. Thus, the MAP goes up from 29.6% (best result on the balanced corpora) to 42.3% (best result on the unbalanced corpora) in the breast cancer domain, and from 16.5% to 26.0% in the diabetes domain. Additionally, these results can be improved by using a prediction model of the word co-occurrence counts. Here, the MAP goes up from 42.3% (best result on the unbalanced corpora) to 46.9% (best result on the unbalanced corpora with prediction) in the breast cancer domain, and from 26.0% to 29.8% in the diabetes domain. We hope that this study will pave the way for using specialized unbalanced comparable corpora for bilingual lexicon extraction.
