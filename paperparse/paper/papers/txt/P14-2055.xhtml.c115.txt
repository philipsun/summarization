 We have introduced a Bayesian summarization method that strongly aligns with intuitions about how people use existing knowledge to identify important events or content in new observations. Our method is especially valuable when a system must utilize a small background corpus. While the update task datasets we have used were carefully selected and grouped by NIST assesors into initial and background sets, for systems on the web, there is little control over the number of background documents on a particular topic. A system should be able to use smaller amounts of background information and as new data arrives, be able to incorporate the evidence. Our Bayesian approach is a natural fit in such a setting.
