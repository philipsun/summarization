 In this paper, We proposed a novel Omni-word feature taking advantages of Chinese sub-phrases. We also introduced the soft constraint method for Chinese relation recognition. The soft constraint utilizes four constraint conditions to catch the structure information in a relation instance. Both the Omni-word feature and soft constrain make better use of information a sentence has, and minimize the deficiency caused by Chinese segmentation and parsing. The size of the employed lexicon determines the dimension of the feature space. The first impression is that more lexicon entries result in more power. However, more lexicon entries also increase the computational complexity and bring in noises. In our future work, we will study this issue. The notion of soft constraints can also be extended to include more patterns, rules, regexes or syntactic constraints that have been used for information extraction. The usability of these strategies is also left for future work.
