 Roediger and Pyc (2012) advocate assisting students in building a strong knowledge base because creative discoveries are unlikely to occur when students do not have a sound set of facts and principles at their command. To that end, automatic question generation systems can facilitate the learning process by alternating passages of text with questions that reinforce the material learned. We have demonstrated a semantic approach to automatic question generation that outperforms similar systems. We evaluated our system on text extracted from open domain STEM textbooks rather than hand-crafted text, showing the robustness of our approach. Our system achieved a 44% reduction in the error rate relative to both the Heilman and Smith, and the Lindberg et al. system on the average over all metrics. The results shows are statistically significant (p 0.001). Our question generator can be used for self-study or tutoring, or by teachers to generate questions for classroom discussion or assessment. Finally, we addressed linguistic challenges to question generation.
