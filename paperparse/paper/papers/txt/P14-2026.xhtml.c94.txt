 In this paper, we introduced a novel pre-ordering approach based on dependency parsing for a Chinese-English PBSMT system. The results showed that our approach achieved a BLEU score gain of 1.61. Moreover, our dependency-based pre-ordering rule set substantially decreased the time for applying pre-ordering rules about 60% compared with WR07, on the training set of 1M sentences pairs. The overall accuracy of our rule set is 60.0%, which is almost at the same level as the WR07 rule set. These results indicated that dependency parsing is more effective for conducting pre-ordering for Chinese-English PBSMT. Although our work focused on Chinese, the ideas can also be applied to other languages. In the future, we attempt to create more efficient pre-ordering rules by exploiting the rich information in dependency structures.
