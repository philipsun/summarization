 We propose an effective content enriching method for microblog, to enhance classification accuracy. News corpus is exploited as external knowledge. As for techniques, our method uses LDA as its topic analysis model and formulates topic inference for new data as convex optimization problems. Compared with traditional representation, enriched microblog shows great improvement in classification tasks. As we do not control the quality of added words, our future work starts from building a filter to select better additional information. And to make the most of external knowledge, better ways to build topic space should be considered.
