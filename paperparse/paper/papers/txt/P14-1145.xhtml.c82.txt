 We have introduced a novel formulation of lexicon induction operating over both words and senses, by exploiting the innate structure between the words and senses as encoded in WordNet. In addition, we introduce the use of loopy belief propagation over pairwise -Markov Random Fields as an effective lexicon induction algorithm. A notable strength of our approach is its expressiveness: various types of prior knowledge and lexical relations can be encoded as node potentials and edge potentials. In addition, it leads to a lexicon of better quality while also offering faster run-time and easiness of implementation. The resulting lexicon, called ConnotationWordNet , is the first lexicon that has polarity labels over both words and senses. ConnotationWordNet is publicly available for research and practical use.
