 In this paper we have proposed an unsupervised Bayesian model, called the Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract the structured representation of events from social media data. Instead of employing labeled corpora for training, the proposed model only requires the identification of named entities, locations and time expressions. After that, the model can automatically extract events which involving a named entity at certain time, location, and with event-related keywords based on the co-occurrence patterns of the event elements. Our proposed model has been evaluated on the FSD corpus. Experimental results show our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by over 7% in F-measure. In future work, we plan to investigate inferring geolocations automatically from tweets. We also intend to study a better method to infer date more accurately from tweets and explore efficient ranking strategies to rank evens extracted for a better presentation of results.
