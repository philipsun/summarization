 We showed that translation from Chinese to English is made more difficult by various discourse events such as the use of discourse connectives, the ambiguity of the connectives and the type of relations they signal. None of these discourse factors has a significant impact on translation quality from Arabic to English. Translation quality from both languages is adversely affected by translations of discourse relations expressed implicitly in one language but explicitly in the other or by paired connectives. Our experiments indicate that discourse usage may affect machine translation between some language pairs but not others, and for particular relations such as contingency . Finally, we established the need to identify sentences in the source language that would be translated into multiple sentences in English. Especially in translating from Chinese to English, there is a large number of such sentences which are currently translated much worse than other sentences.
