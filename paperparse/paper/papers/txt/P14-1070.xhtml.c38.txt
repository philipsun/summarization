 We experimented strategies to predict both MWE analysis and dependency structure, and tested them on the dependency version of French Treebank [ 1 ] , as instantiated in the SPMRL Shared Task [ 23 ] . Our work focused on using an alternative representation of syntactically regular MWEs, which captures their syntactic internal structure. We obtain a system with comparable performance to that of previous works on this dataset, but which predicts both syntactic dependencies and the internal structure of MWEs. This can be useful for capturing the various degrees of semantic compositionality of MWEs. The main weakness of our system comes from the identification of regular MWEs, a property which is highly lexical. Our current use of external lexicons does not seem to suffice, and the use of data-driven external information to better cope with this identification can be envisaged.
