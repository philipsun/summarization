 This paper adds to existing evidence from previous research that the introduction of an explicit disambiguation step before the composition improves the quality of the produced composed representations. The use of a robust regression model rejects the hypothesis that the proposed methodology is helpful only for relatively u'\u201c' weak u'\u201d' compositional approaches. As for future work, an interesting direction would be to see how a prior disambiguation step can affect deep learning compositional settings similar to [] and [] .
