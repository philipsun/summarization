 The most important conclusion we draw from this work is the most appropriate agreement metric for syntactic annotation. First of all, we disqualify the LAS metric, primarily due to the methodological inadequacies of using an uncorrected measure. While our experiments did not reveal any serious shortcomings (unlike those of [] who in the case of categorisation showed that for large p the uncorrected measure can be increasing ), the methodological problems of uncorrected metrics makes us wary of LAS as an agreement metric. Next, of the three u'\u0391' metrics, u'\u0391' p u'\u2062' l u'\u2062' a u'\u2062' i u'\u2062' n is clearly the best; u'\u0391' d u'\u2062' i u'\u2062' f u'\u2062' f is extremely sensitive to even moderate amounts of disagreement, while u'\u0391' n u'\u2062' o u'\u2062' r u'\u2062' m is overly lenient. Looking solely at Figure 3 , one might be led to believe that LAS and u'\u0391' p u'\u2062' l u'\u2062' a u'\u2062' i u'\u2062' n are interchangeable, but this is not the case. As shown by Figures 4 and 5 , the paraboloid shape of the LAS curve in Figure 3 is simply the combination of the metric u'\u2019' s linear responses to both label and structural perturbations. The behaviour of u'\u0391' on the other hand is more complex, with structural noise being penalised harder than perturbations of the labels. Thus, the similarity of LAS and u'\u0391' p u'\u2062' l u'\u2062' a u'\u2062' i u'\u2062' n is not at all assured when the amounts of structural and labelling disagreements differ. Additionally, we consider this imbalanced weighting of structural and labelling disagreements a benefit, as structure is the larger part of syntactic annotation compared to the labelling of the dependencies/bracketings. Finally our experiments show that u'\u0391' is a single metric that is applicable to both dependencies and phrase structure trees. Furthermore, u'\u0391' metrics are far more flexible than simple accuracy metrics. The use of a distance function to define the metric means that more fine-grained distinctions can be made; for example, if the set of labels on the structures is highly structured, partial credit can be given for differing annotations that overlap. For example, if different types of adverbials (temporal, negation, etc.) receive different relations, as is the case in the Swedish Talbanken05 [] corpus, confusion of different adverbial types can be given less weight than confusion between subject and object. The u'\u0391' -based metrics are also far easier to apply to a more complex annotation task such as the tectogrammatical annotation of the PCEDT. In this task inserting and deleting nodes is an integral part of the annotation, and if two annotators insert or delete different nodes the all-or-nothing requirement of identical yield of the LAS metric makes it impossible as an evaluation metric in this setting.
