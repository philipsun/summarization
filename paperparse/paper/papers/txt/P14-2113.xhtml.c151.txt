 We present a sentiment analysis-based approach to online dispute detection. We create a large-scale dispute corpus from Wikipedia Talk pages to study the problem. A sentiment prediction model based on isotonic CRFs is proposed to output sentiment labels at the sentence-level. Experiments on our dispute corpus also demonstrate that classifiers trained with sentiment tagging features outperform others that do not. Acknowledgments We heartily thank the Cornell NLP Group, the reviewers, and Yiye Ruan for helpful comments. We also thank Emily Bender and Mari Ostendorf for providing the AAWD dataset.
