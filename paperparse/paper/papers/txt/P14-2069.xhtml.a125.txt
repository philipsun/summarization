 Emotion lexicons play a crucial role in sentiment analysis and opinion mining. In this paper, we propose a novel Emotion-aware LDA (EaLDA) model to build a domain-specific lexicon for predefined emotions that include anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The model uses a minimal set of domain-independent seed words as prior knowledge to discover a domain-specific lexicon, learning a fine-grained emotion lexicon much richer and adaptive to a specific domain. By comprehensive experiments, we show that our model can generate a high-quality fine-grained domain-specific emotion lexicon. u'\u2021' ] MinYang §] BaolinPeng §] ZhengChen u'\u2020' ,¶] DingjuZhu u'\u2020' u'\u2020' thanks: DingjuZhuisthecorrespondingauthor u'\u2021' ] Kam-PuiChow \affil [ u'\u2020' ]SchoolofComputerScience,SouthChinaNormalUniversity,Guangzhou,China \affil [] dingjuzhu@gmail.com \affil [ u'\u2021' ]DepartmentofComputerScience,TheUniversityofHongKong,HongKong \affil []{ myang,chow } @cs.hku.hk \affil [§]DepartmentofComputerScience,BeihangUniversity,Beijing,China \affil [] b.peng@cse.buaa.edu.cn,tzchen86@gmail.com \affil [¶]ShenzhenInstitutesofAdvancedTechnology,ChineseAcademyofSciences,Shenzhen,China english
