 We have presented an unsupervised framework for abstractive summarization of spoken and written conversations based on phrasal queries. For content selection, we propose a sentence extraction model that incorporates query relevance and content importance into the extraction process. For the generation phase, we propose a ranking strategy which selects the best path in the constructed word graph based on fluency, query relevance and content. Both automatic and manual evaluation of our model show substantial improvement over extraction-based methods, including Biased LexRank, which is considered a state-of-the-art system. Moreover, our system also yields good grammaticality score for human evaluation and achieves comparable scores with the original sentences. Our future work is four-fold. First, we are trying to improve our model by incorporating conversational features (e.g., speech acts). Second, we aim at implementing a strategy to order the clusters for generating more coherent abstracts. Third, we try to improve our generated summary by resolving coreferences and incorporating speaker information (e.g., names) in the clustering and sentence generation phases. Finally, we plan to take advantage of topic shifts to better segment the relevant parts of conversations in relation to phrasal queries.
