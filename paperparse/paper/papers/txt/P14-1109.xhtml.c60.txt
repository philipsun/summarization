 In this work, we have demonstrated that the more complex quarterly earnings calls can also be used to predict the measured volatility of the stocks in the limited future. We propose a novel semiparametric Gausian copula regression approach that models the dependency structure of the language in the earnings calls. Unlike traditional bag-of-features models that work discrete features from various signals, we perform kernel density estimation to smooth out the distribution, and use probability integral transform to work with CDFs that are uniform. The copula model deals with marginal CDFs and the correlation among them separately, in a cleaner manner that is also flexible to parameterize. Focusing on the three financial crisis related datasets, the proposed model significantly outperform the standard linear regression method in statistics and strong discriminative support vector regression baselines. By varying the size of the training data and the dimensionality of the covariates, we have demonstrated that our proposed model is relatively robust across different parameter settings.
