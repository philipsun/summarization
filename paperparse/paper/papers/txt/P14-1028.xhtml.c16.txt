 In this paper, we propose a new model called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network that explicitly models the interactions between tags and context characters. Moreover, we propose a tensor factorization approach that effectively improves the model efficiency and avoids the risk of overfitting. Experiments on the benchmark datasets show that our model achieve better results than previous neural network models and that our model can achieve a competitive result with minimal feature engineering. In the future, we plan to further extend our model and apply it to other structure prediction problems.
