 This work focuses on two important aspects of answer reranking for non-factoid QA: similarity between question and answer content, and answer structure. While the former has been addressed with a variety of lexical-semantic models, the latter has received little attention. Here we show how to model answer structures using discourse and how to integrate the two aspects into a holistic framework. Empirically we show that modeling answer discourse structures is complementary to modeling lexical semantic similarity and that the best performance is obtained when they are tightly integrated. We evaluate the proposed approach on multiple genres and question types and obtain benefits of up to 24% relative improvement over a strong baseline that combines information retrieval and lexical semantics. We further demonstrate that answer discourse structures are largely independent of domain and transfer well, even between radically different datasets.
