 In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for learning sentence-level sentiment. Our approach incorporates intuitive lexical and discourse knowledge as expressive constraints while training a conditional random field model via posterior regularization. We explore a rich set of context-aware constraints at both intra- and inter-sentential levels, and demonstrate their effectiveness in the analysis of sentence-level sentiment. While we focus on the sentence-level task, our approach can be easily extended to handle sentiment analysis at finer levels of granularity. Our experiments show that our model achieves better accuracy than existing supervised and semi-supervised models for the sentence-level sentiment classification task.
