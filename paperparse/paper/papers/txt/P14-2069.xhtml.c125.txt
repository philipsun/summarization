 In this paper, we have presented a novel emotion-aware LDA model that is able to quickly build a fine-grained domain-specific emotion lexicon for languages without many manually constructed resources. The proposed EaLDA model extends the standard LDA model by accepting a set of domain-independent emotion words as prior knowledge, and guiding to group semantically related words into the same emotion category. Thus, it makes the emotion lexicon containing much richer and adaptive domain-specific emotion words. Experimental results showed that the emotional lexicons generated by our algorithm is of high quality, and can assist emotion classification task. For future works, we hope to extend the proposed EaLDA model by exploiting discourse structure knowledge, which has been shown significant in identifying the polarity of content-aware words.
