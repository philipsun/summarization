 In this paper, we show that disagreements between professional or lay annotators are systematic and consistent across domains and some of them are systematic also across languages. In addition, we present an empirical analysis of POS annotations showing that the vast majority of inter-annotator disagreements are competing, but valid, linguistic interpretations. We propose to embrace such disagreements rather than using annotation guidelines to optimize inter-annotator agreement, which would bias our models in favor of some linguistic theory.
