 This paper demonstrates that morphology and distributional features can be combined in a flexible, joint probabilistic model, using the distance-dependent Chinese Restaurant Process. A key advantage of this framework is the ability to include arbitrary features in the prior distribution. Future work may exploit this advantage more thoroughly: for example, by using features that incorporate prior knowledge of the language u'\u2019' s morphological structure. Another important goal is the evaluation of this method on languages beyond English.
