 Our knowledge graph propagation is generally effective at producing useful sentiment lexicons. Interestingly, the ratio of positive sentiment words is strongly connected with number of sentiment words u'\u2013' it is noteworthy that English has the smallest ratio of positive lexicon terms. The phenomenon possibly shows that many negative words reflecting cultural nuances do not translate wel. We believe that this ratio can be considered as quality measurement of the propagation. Similar approaches can be extended to other NLP tasks using different semantic links, specific dictionary and special seed words. Future work will revolve around learning modifiers, negation terms, and various entity/sentiment attribution.
