 Parallel treebank construction efforts increased significantly in the recent years. Many parallel treebanks are produced to build statistically strong language models for different languages. In this study, we report our preliminary efforts to build such a parallel corpus for Turkish-English pair. We translated and transformed a subset of parse trees of Penn Treebank to Turkish. We cover more than 50% of all sentences with a maximum length of 15-words including punctuation. This work constitutes the preliminary step of parallel treebank generation. As a next step, we will focus on morphological analysis and disambiguation of Turkish words. After determining the correct morphological analysis of Turkish words, we will use the parts of these analyses to replace the leaf nodes that we intentionally left as u'\u201c' *NONE* u'\u201d' . As a future work, we plan to expand the dataset to include all Penn Treebank sentences.
