 We proposed an automatic method for Question Answering from structured data source (Freebase). Our approach associates question features with answer patterns described by Freebase and has achieved state-of-the-art results on a balanced and realistic QA corpus. To compensate for the problem of domain mismatch or overfitting, we exploited ClueWeb, mined mappings between KB relations and natural language text, and showed that it helped both relation prediction and answer extraction. Our method employs relatively lightweight machinery but has good performance. We hope that this result establishes a new baseline against which semantic parsing researchers can measure their progress towards deeper language understanding and answering of human questions. We thank the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence for funding this work.
