 Cross-language article linking is the task of creating links between online encyclopedia articles in different languages that describe the same content. We propose a method based on article hypernym and topic model to link English Wikipedia articles to corresponding Chinese Baidu Baike articles. Our method comprises two stages: candidate selection and candidate ranking. We formulate candidate selection as a cross-language information retrieval task based on the title similarity between English and Chinese articles. In candidate ranking, we employ several features of the articles in our SVM model. To evaluate our method, we compile a dataset from English Wikipedia and Baidu Baike, containing the 500 most popular Baidu articles. Evaluation results of our method show an MRR of up to 80.95% and a recall of 87.46%. This shows that our method is effective in generating cross-language links between English Wikipedia and Baidu Baike with high accuracy. Our method does not heavily depend on linguistic characteristics and can be easily extended to generate cross-language article links among different encyclopedias in other languages.
