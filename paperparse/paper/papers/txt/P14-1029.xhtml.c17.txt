 Negation plays a fundamental role in modifying sentiment. In the process of semantic composition, the impact of negators is complicated by the syntax and semantics of the text spans they modify. This paper provides a comprehensive and quantitative study of the behavior of negators through a unified view of fitting human annotation. We first measure the modeling capabilities of two influential heuristics on a sentiment treebank and find that they capture some effect of negation; however, extending these non-lexicalized models to be dependent on the negators improves the performance statistically significantly. The detailed analysis reveals the differences in the behavior among negators, and we argue that they should always be modeled separately. We further make the models to be dependent on the text being modified by negators, through adaptation of a state-of-the-art recursive neural network to incorporate the syntax and semantics of the arguments; we discover this further reduces fitting errors.
