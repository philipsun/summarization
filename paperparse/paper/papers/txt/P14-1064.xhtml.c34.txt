 In this work, we presented an approach that can expand a translation model extracted from a sentence-aligned, bilingual corpus using a large amount of unstructured, monolingual data in both source and target languages, which leads to improvements of 1.4 and 1.2 BLEU points over strong baselines on evaluation sets, and in some scenarios gains in excess of 4 BLEU points. In the future, we plan to estimate the graph structure through other learned, distributed representations.
