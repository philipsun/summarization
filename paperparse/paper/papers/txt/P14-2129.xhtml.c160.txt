 We proposed a novel partial parsing approach for applications that require a fast syntactic analysis of the input beyond shallow bracketing. The span-limit parameter allows tuning the annotation of internal structure as appropriate for the application domain, trading off annotation complexity against inference time. These properties make hedge parsing potentially very useful for incremental text or speech processing, such as streaming text analysis or simultaneous translation. One interesting characteristic of these annotations is that they allow for string segmentation prior to inference, provided that the segment boundaries do not cross any hedge boundaries. We found that baseline segmentation models did provide a significant speedup in parsing, but that cascading errors remain a problem. There are many directions of future work to pursue here. First, the current results are all for exhaustive CYK parsing, and we plan to perform a detailed investigation of the performance of hedgebank parsing with prioritization and pruning methods of the sort available in BUBS [ 2 ] . Further, this sort of annotation seems well suited to incremental parsing with beam search, which has been shown to achieve high accuracies even for fully connected parsing [ 14 ] . Improvements to the transform (e.g., grouping items not in hedges under non-terminals) and to the segmentation model (e.g., increasing precision at the expense of recall) could improve accuracy without greatly reducing efficiency. Finally, we intend to perform an extrinsic evaluation of this parsing in an on-line task such as simultaneous translation.
