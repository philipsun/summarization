 Our work aims to help people speak foreign languages they don u'\u2019' t know, by providing native phonetic spellings that approximate the sounds of foreign phrases. We use a cascade of finite-state transducers to accomplish the task. We improve the model by adding phrases, word boundary constraints, and improved alignment. In the future, we plan to cover more language pairs and directions. Each target language raises interesting new challenges that come from its natural constraints on allowed phonemes, syllables, words, and orthography.
