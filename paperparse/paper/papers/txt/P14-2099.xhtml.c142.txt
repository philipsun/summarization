 We considered the task of aligning sections of a collection of roughly similarly-structured legal documents, based on the issues they address. We introduced an unsupervised model for this task along with two new (and reusable) evaluations. Our experiments show the approach to be more effective than clustering and topic models. The corpus and evaluation data have been made available at http://usableprivacy.org/data . In future work, policy section alignments will be used in automated analysis to extract useful information for users and privacy scholars.
