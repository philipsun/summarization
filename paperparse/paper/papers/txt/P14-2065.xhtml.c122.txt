 Results of Phase 1 provide support for the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis, at least as a strong bias. More work will be needed to determine the strength of that bias. The findings are largely consistent with VerbNet u'\u2019' s semantics, but changes are indicated in some cases. We find that inter-annotator agreement is sufficiently high that annotation can be done effectively using the modal response with an average of 6-7 responses per item. We are currently investigating whether we can achieve better reliability with fewer responses per item by taking into account an individual annotator u'\u2019' s history across items, as recent work suggests is possible [ 13 , 17 , 19 ] . Thus, crowd-sourcing VerbNet semantic entailments appears to be both feasible and productive. Data-collection continues. Phase 2, which added over 10 new verb classes, is complete. Phase 3, which includes both new classes and new entailments, has been launched.
