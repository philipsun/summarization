 We have described a dynamic convolutional neural network that uses the dynamic k -max pooling operator as a non-linear subsampling function. The feature graph induced by the network is able to capture word relations of varying size. The network achieves high performance on question and sentiment classification without requiring external features as provided by parsers or other resources.
