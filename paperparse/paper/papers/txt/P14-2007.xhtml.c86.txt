 We presented a metric called Sentiment Annotation Complexity (SAC), a metric in SA research that has been unexplored until now. First, the process of data preparation through eye tracking, labeled with the SAC score was elaborated. Using this data set and a set of linguistic features, we trained a regression model to predict SAC. Our predictive framework for SAC resulted in a mean percentage error of 22.02%, and a moderate correlation of 0.57 between the predicted and observed SAC values. Finally, we observe a negative correlation between the classifier confidence scores and a SAC, as expected. As a future work, we would like to investigate how SAC of a test sentence can be used to choose a classifier from an ensemble, and to determine the pre-processing steps (entity-relationship extraction, for example).
