 Medical record retrieval is an important domain-specific IR problem. Concept-based representation is an effective approach to dealing with ambiguity terminology in medical domain. However, the results of the NLP tools used to generate the concept-based representation are often not perfect. In this paper, we present a general methodology that can use axiomatic approaches as guidance to regularize the concept weighting strategies to address the limitations caused by the inaccurate concept mapping and improve the retrieval performance. In particular, we proposed two weighting regularization methods based on the relations among concepts. Experimental results show that the proposed methods can significantly outperform existing retrieval functions. There are many interesting directions for our future work. First, we plan to study how to automatically predict whether to use concept-based indexing based on the quality of MetaMap results, and explore whether the proposed methods are applicable for other entity linking methods. Second, we will study how to leverage other information from knowledge bases to further improve the performance. Third, more experiments could be conducted to examine the effectiveness of the proposed methods when using other ranking strategies. Finally, it would be interesting to study how to follow the proposed methodology to study other domain-specific IR problems.
