 In this paper, we have presented a unified reordering framework to incorporate soft linguistic constraints (of syntactic or semantic nature) into the HPB translation model. The syntactic reordering models take CFG rules and model their reordering on the target side, while the semantic reordering models work with PAS. Experiments on Chinese-English translation show that the reordering approach can significantly improve a state-of-the-art hierarchical phrase-based translation system. We have also discussed the differences between the two linguistic reordering models. There are many directions in which this work can be continued. First, the syntactic reordering model can be extended to model reordering among constituents that cross CFG rules. Second, although we do not see obvious gain from the semantic reordering model when the syntactic model is adopted, it might be beneficial to further jointly consider the two reordering models, focusing on where each one does well. Third, to better examine the overlap or synergy between our approach and the non-syntax-based reordering approach, we will conduct direct comparisons and combinations with the latter.
