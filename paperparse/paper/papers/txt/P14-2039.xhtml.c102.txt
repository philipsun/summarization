 In this paper, we present a novel sliding window based text alignment algorithm for real-time crowd captioning. By effectively addressing the problem of alignment errors at chunk boundaries, our sliding window approach outperforms the existing fixed window based system [] in terms of word error rate, particularly when the chunk size is small, and thus achieves higher accuracy at lower latency.
