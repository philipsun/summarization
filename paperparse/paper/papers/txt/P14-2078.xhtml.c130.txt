 The presented system provides a robust semantic disambiguation method, based on mutual relation of entities inside a document, using a standard annotation engine. It uses co-reference, NE normalization methods, and Wikipedia internal links as mutual disambiguation resource to improve the annotations. We show that our proposition improves the performance of a standard annotation engine applied to the TAC-KBP evaluation framework. SemLinker is fully implemented, and publicly released as an open source toolkit ( http://code.google.com/p/semlinker ). It has been deployed in the TAC-KBP 2013 evaluation campaign. Our future work will integrate other annotation engines in the system architecture in a collaborative approach.
