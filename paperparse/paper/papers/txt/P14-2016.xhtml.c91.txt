 We have described initial results for a method designed to automatically detect multilingual dictionaries on the web, and attained highly credible results over both a synthetic dataset and an experiment over the open web using a web search engine. In future work, we hope to explore the ability of the method to detect domain-specific dictionaries (e.g.Â training over domain-specific dictionaries from other language pairs), and low-density languages where there are few dictionaries and Wikipedia articles to train the method on.
