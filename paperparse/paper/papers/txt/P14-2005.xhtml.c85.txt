 The original BLANC-gold [ 7 ] requires that system mentions be identical to gold mentions, which limits the metric u'\u2019' s utility since detected system mentions often have missing key mentions or spurious mentions. The proposed BLANC is free from this assumption, and we have shown that it subsumes the original BLANC-gold. Since BLANC works on imperfect system mentions, we have used it to score the CoNLL 2011 and 2012 coreference systems. The BLANC scores show strong correlation with existing metrics, especially B-cubed and CEAF-m.
