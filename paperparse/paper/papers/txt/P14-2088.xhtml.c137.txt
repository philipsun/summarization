 Denoising autoencoders provide an intuitive solution for domain adaptation: transform the features into a representation that is resistant to the noise that may characterize the domain adaptation process. The original implementation of this idea produced this noise directly [ 12 ] ; later work showed that dropout noise could be analytically marginalized [ 4 ] . We take another step towards simplicity by showing that structured dropout can make marginalization even easier, obtaining dramatic speedups without sacrificing accuracy. : We thank the reviewers for useful feedback.
