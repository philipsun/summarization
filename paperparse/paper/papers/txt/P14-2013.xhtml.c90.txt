 Our results show that Page-Rank in conjunction with re-ranking by initial confidence score can be used as an effective approach to collectively disambiguate named entity textual mentions in a document. Our proposed features are very simple and easy to extract, and work well when employed in PR. In future work we plan to explore enriching the edges between nodes by incorporating semantic relations extracted from an ontology.
