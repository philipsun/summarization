 We carried out a systematic study on OM from YouTube comments by training a set of supervised multi-class classifiers distinguishing between video and product related opinions. We use standard feature vectors augmented by shallow syntactic trees enriched with additional conceptual information. This paper makes several contributions: (i) it shows that effective OM can be carried out with supervised models trained on high quality annotations; (ii) it introduces a novel annotated corpus of YouTube comments, which we make available for the research community; (iii) it defines novel structural models and kernels, which can improve on feature vectors, e.g., up to 30% of relative improvement in type classification, when little data is available, and demonstrates that the structural model scales well to other domains. In the future, we plan to work on a joint model to classify all the comments of a given video, s.t. it is possible to exploit latent dependencies between entities and the sentiments of the comment thread. Additionally, we plan to experiment with hierarchical multi-label classifiers for the full task (in place of a flat multi-class learner).
