 Perceptions of the factuality of quoted content are influenced by the cue words used to introduce them, while extra-linguistic factors, such as the source and the author, did not appear to be relevant in our experiments. This result is obtained from real tweets written by journalists; a natural counterpart study would be to experimentally manipulate this framing to see if the same perceptions apply. Another future direction would be to test whether the deployment of cue words as framing devices reflects the ideology of the journalist. We are also interested to group multiple instances of the same quote [ 7 ] , and examine how its framing varies across different news outlets and over time.
