 We show that relation extractors trained with distant supervision can benefit significantly from a small number of human labeled examples. We propose a strategy to generate and select guidelines so that they are more generalized forms of labeled instances. We show how to incorporate these guidelines into an existing state-of-art model for relation extraction. Our approach significantly improves performance in practice and thus opens up many opportunities for further research in RE where only a very limited amount of labeled training data is available.
