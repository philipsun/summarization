 This paper presented a composite kernel approach for dialog topic tracking. This approach aimed to represent various types of domain knowledge obtained from Wikipedia as two structures: history sequences and domain context trees; then incorporate them into the model with kernel methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approaches helped to improve the topic tracking performances in mixed-initiative human-human dialogs with respect to the baseline model.
