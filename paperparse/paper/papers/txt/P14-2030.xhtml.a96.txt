 Motivated by work predicting coarse-grained author categories in social media, such as gender or political preference, we explore whether Twitter contains information to support the prediction of fine-grained categories, or social roles . We find that the simple self-identification pattern u'\u201c' I am a u'\u201d' supports significantly richer classification than previously explored, successfully retrieving a variety of fine-grained roles. For a given role (e.g., writer ), we can further identify characteristic attributes using a simple possessive construction (e.g., writer u'\u2019' s ). Tweets that incorporate the attribute terms in first person possessives ( my ) are confirmed to be an indicator that the author holds the associated social role.
