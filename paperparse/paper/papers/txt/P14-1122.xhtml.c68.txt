 Two video games have been presented for validating and extending knowledge bases. The first game, Infection, validates concept-concept relations, and the second, The Knowledge Towers, validates image-concept relations. In experiments involving online players, we demonstrate three contributions. First, games were released in two conditions whereby players either saw financial incentives for playing or a personal satisfaction incentive where they were thanked by us. We demonstrated that both conditions produced nearly identical numbers of annotations and, moreover, that players were disinterested in the satisfaction incentive, suggesting they played out of interest in the game itself. Furthermore, we demonstrated the effectiveness of a novel design for games with a purpose which does not require two players for validation and instead reinforces behavior only using true negative items that required no manual annotation. Second, in a comparison with crowdsourcing, we demonstrate that video game-based annotations consistently generated higher-quality annotations. Last, we demonstrate that video game-based annotation can be more cost-effective than crowdsourcing or annotation tasks with game-like features: The significant number of annotations generated by the satisfaction incentive condition shows that a fun game can generate high-quality annotations at virtually no cost. All annotated resources, demos of the games, and a live version of the top-ranking items for each concept are currently available online. 5 5 http://lcl.uniroma1.it/games/ In the future we will apply our video games to the validation of more data, such as the new Wikipedia bitaxonomy [ 11 ] .
