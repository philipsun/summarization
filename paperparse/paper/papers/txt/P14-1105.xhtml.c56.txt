 In this paper we apply recursive neural networks to political ideology detection, a problem where previous work relies heavily on bag-of-words models and hand-designed lexica. We show that our approach detects bias more accurately than existing methods on two different datasets. In addition, we describe an approach to crowdsourcing ideological bias annotations. We use this approach to create a new dataset from the ibc , which is labeled at both the sentence and phrase level.
