 We proposed a method of summarizing a single document that included relations between sentences and relations between words. We built a nested tree and formulated the problem of summarization as that of integer linear programming. Our method significantly improved the ROUGE score with significantly fewer sentences than the method of EDU selection. The results suggest that our method relaxed the fragmentation of information. We also discussed the effectiveness of sentence subtree selection that did not restrict rooted subtrees. Although ROUGE scores are widely used as evaluation metrics for text summarization systems, they cannot take into consideration linguistic qualities such as human readability. Hence, we plan to conduct evaluations with people 7 7 For example, the quality question metric from the Document Understanding Conference (DUC). . We only used the rhetorical structures between sentences in this study. However, there were also rhetorical structures between EDUs inside individual sentences. Hence, utilizing these for sentence compression has been left for future work. In addition, we used rhetorical structures that were manually annotated. There have been related studies on building RST parsers [ 7 , 1 ] and by using such parsers, we should be able to apply our model to other corpora or to multi-document settings.
