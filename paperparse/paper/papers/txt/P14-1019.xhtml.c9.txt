 This paper demonstrates the power of combining a simple inference procedure with a highly expressive scoring function. Our model achieves the best results on the standard dependency parsing benchmark, outperforming parsing methods with elaborate inference procedures. In addition, this framework provides simple and effective means for joint parsing and corrective tagging.
