 For Korean SRL, we semantically annotated a corpus containing detailed morphological annotation. We then developed a supervised model which leverages Korean-specific features and a variety of latent morpheme representations to help deal with a sparsity problem. Our best model achieved 81.07% in F1-score. In the future, we will continue to build our corpus and look for the way to use unsupervised learning for SRL to apply to another language which does not have available corpus.
