 We proposed a supervised method for event causality extraction that exploits semantic relation, context, and association features. We also proposed methods for our new task, future scenario generation. The methods chain event causality by causal-compatibility. We generated non-trivial scenarios with reasonable precision, and u'\u201c' predicted u'\u201d' future events from web documents. Increasing their rank is future work.
