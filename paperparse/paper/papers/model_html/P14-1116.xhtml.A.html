<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We present a novel approach for automatic report generation from time-series data, in the context of student feedback generation..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Our proposed methodology treats content selection as a multi-label (ML) classification problem, which takes as input time-series data and outputs a set of templates, while capturing the dependencies between selected templates..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We show that this method generates output closer to the feedback that lecturers actually generated, achieving 3.5% higher accuracy and 15% higher F-score than multiple simple classifiers that keep a history of selected templates..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Furthermore, we compare a ML classifier with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach in simulation and using ratings from real student users..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We show that the different methods have different benefits, with ML being more accurate for predicting what was seen in the training data, whereas RL is more exploratory and slightly preferred by the students..</a>

<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> Your overall performance was excellent during the semester..</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> Keep up the good work and maybe try some more challenging exercises..</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11> Your attendance was varying over the semester..</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12> Have a think about how to use time in lectures to improve your understanding of the material..</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13> You spent 2 hours studying the lecture material on average..</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14> You should dedicate more time to study..</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15> You seem to find the material easier to understand compared to the beginning of the semester..</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16> Keep up the good work..</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17> You revised part of the learning material..</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18> Have a think whether revising has improved your performance..</a>
