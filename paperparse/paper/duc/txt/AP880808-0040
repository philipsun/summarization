john lennon spent much of a three-year span tucked away in his room, sleeping or sitting in a lotus position with his head enveloped in tobacco or marijuana smoke, according to a biography of the slain beatle.
an excerpt from the book, ``the lives of john lennon'' by journalist and biographer albert goldman, appearing in the aug. 15 issue of people magazine, discloses a sometimes unflattering portrait of both lennon and his second wife, yoko ono.
the book is scheduled to be published later this month by william morrow co. inc.
between 1976 and 1979, goldman writes, lennon ``could not be more remote.''
apart from a few hours in the morning and evening, including time spent with his son, sean, ``lennon is back here in his room, alone and silent.''
the author says the idolized beatle spent most of his adult life as an anorexic, starving himself to what he perceived as perfection. the onset of the eating disorder can be traced to 1965, goldman writes, ``when some fool described him in print as the `fat beatle.' ''
``that phrase struck such a blow to his fragile ego that the wound has never healed.''
lennon rarely wore clothing, other than a pair of backless slippers, and avoided touching anyone, according to the book.
the 719-page biography also details yoko ono's $5,000-a-week heroin habit in 1979. she reportedly snorted the drug.
according to the book, lennon also took heroin and consumed a great deal of lsd.
``i must have taken a thousand trips,'' the book quotes lennon as saying. ``i just ate it all the time like candy.''
goldman spent more than six years researching the book, interviewing 1,200 friends, relatives and associates of lennon, who was murdered eight years ago in new york.
