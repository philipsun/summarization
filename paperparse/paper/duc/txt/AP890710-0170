president corazon aquino of the philippines on monday asked government and industrial leaders to expand economic ties with her nation.
mrs. aquino, on the first stop of her weeklong three-nation european tour, met with west german president richard von weizsaecker, foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher and other officials.
mrs. aquino, comparing the task of strengthening the heavily indebted philippine economy to the recovery of west germany after world war ii, asked that germany share its experience with her homeland.
``we have tried by sound fiscal policies not to buy recovery at the price of inflation, nor debt relief at the price of national honor,'' she said in a speech to the west german chamber of industry and trade.
``we have paid as careful attention to the consequences of runaway inflation and devaluation as germany in the light of her own experiences between the wars,'' she said.
mrs. aquino said the philippines' debt was projected to increase to $29 billion by year's end but that much was money that ``was in fact stolen by the previous government'' of ousted dictator ferdinand marcos.
she said that since her government took over in 1986, the country's growth rate of minus 10 percent under marcos in 1985 had improved to a rate of plus 6.7 percent by 1988.
``what we need to complete the equation are two elements essential to the german recovery _ debt relief and investments,'' mrs. aquino said.
during a state banquet in the evening, weizsaecker told mrs. aquino her visit would further strengthen relations between west germany and the philippines.
weizsaecker said the philippines have had good results in trade with west germany, and assured mrs. aquino that the barrier-free market the european economic community plans for 1992 will not lock out trade with other countries.
mrs. aquino, who arrived in west germany on sunday, will meet with chancellor helmut kohl on tuesday before departing for paris. she also is to visit belgium.
