leonard bernstein, whose wide-ranging talents and flamboyant personality helped make him the first american maestro to conquer music's international podium, was buried today alongside his wife.
bernstein, who died of lung failure sunday at age 72, was buried this afternoon in private ceremonies at greenwood cemetery in brooklyn. his wife, felicia montealegre, died in 1978.
flags at lincoln center, where the new york philharmonic performs, were lowered in memory of the orchestra's first american-born music director. bernstein was appointed in 1958 and stepped down in 1969 to spend more time composing.
the philharmonic will perform an all-bernstein program beginning thursday and continuing through oct. 23. the schedule had called for works by shostakovich and beethoven.
a memorial concert also is planned for carnegie hall on nov. 14, the 47th anniversary of bernstein's philharmonic debut.
famed for his gymnastics at the podium, bernstein composed symphonies as well as movie scores and broadway shows such as ``west side story,'' ``on the town'' and ``candide.''
his emmy-winning ``young people's concerts'' on television introduced thousands to classical music.
``he was the most unique musician of this century, there is no doubt about it,'' said zubin mehta, music director of the new york philharmonic and the israel philharmonic orchestra.
larry kert, who played tony in the broadway production of ``west side story,'' said bernstein himself played the piano for him during rehearsals.
``he could have gotten a rehearsal pianist, but he cared too much,'' kert said. ``i was the new kid on the block and he stroked me and took care of me - and i will never forget him for that.''
