indian frontier guards shot and killed 20 moslem militants and arrested nine others after they sneaked into india-held kashmir from pakistan, a senior official said today.
the militants were killed late monday at kupwara, 56 miles north of srinagar during gunbattle with indian guards, said the kashmir official, who cannot be identified under standing briefing regulations.
india, alarmed by a spurt in moslem separatist activities in kashmir, has stepped up border patrol to stop alleged infiltration of separatists from pakistan. a total of 80 moslem militants have died in frontier incidents in the past week.
indian officials maintain that kashmiri militants regularly cross over to pakistan through the porous border and return by the same route after reciving arms training in pakistan.
pakistan denies it is training or helping the militants, but says it supports the separatism, terming it a fight for self determination.
the kashmir official said the fighting erupted when the militants fired at indian border guards after crossing over from pakistan.
indian guards seized 22 ak-47 rifles, three machine guns and 1,425 rounds of ammunitions.
kashmiri separatists are fighting for independence of the moslem dominated jammu-kashmir from the predominantly hindu india.
at least five more moslem separatists were killed in three separate incidents across kashmir today.
the deaths brought the total number of people killed to at least 863 since jan. 20, when the government launched a crackdown on the separatists.
about 65 percent of jammu-kashmir's 6 million people are moslems, making it india's only moslem majority state. nationwide, moslems make up 12 percent of india's 880 million people.
hindus make up 82 percent of the population.
kashmiri separatists earlier demanded union with pakistan, an islamic country, but have recently been fighting for total independence and the status of a neutral country.
