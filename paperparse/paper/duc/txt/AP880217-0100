the motion picture industry's most coveted award, oscar, was created 60 years ago and 1,816 of the statuettes have been produced so far.
weighing 8{ pounds and standing 13{ inches tall, oscar was created by metro-goldwyn-mayer studios art director cedric gibbons, who went on to win 11 of the trophies.
oscar, manufactured by the r.s. owens co., chicago, is made of britannia metal, copper plate, nickel plate and gold plate. from 1942 to 1944, the trophy was made of plaster, but winners were later presented with the real thing.
according to the academy of motion pictures arts and sciences, the only engraving mistake was in 1938 when the best actor trophy given to spencer tracy for ``boy's town'' read: ``best actor: dick tracy.''
the academy holds all the rights on the statue and ``reserves the right to buy back an oscar before someone takes it to a pawn shop,'' said academy spokesman bob werden.
the most-nominated film was ``all about eve'' in 1950. it got 14 nominations. ``ben-hur'' in 1959 was the most-awarded film with 11, and walt disney was the most-awarded person with 32.
