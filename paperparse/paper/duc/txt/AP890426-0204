actor gale gordon, a sidekick of lucille ball from radio days who appeared with her in three television series, recalled on wednesday how the comedian never thought of herself as particularly funny.
``oh, but when she told a story or recalled an event that happened she always illustrated it with her body and her face,'' the 83-year-old gordon said in a telephone interview. ``she never saw it, but she was extremely amusing.''
gordon, who is appearing in a play in edmonton, spent the day in an edmonton hotel room, mourning the death of lucille ball in a los angeles hospital wednesday at age 77 and quietly remembering his funny friend.
``the world will miss her greatly,'' the actor said. ``i personally will remember her as the best talent of her kind in the world ... a wonderful, warm friend and a bit of a genius _ the only one i've ever really known.''
in his first television series alongside miss ball, gordon was the flustered banker mr. mooney in ``the lucy show'' from 1962-68. the next six years saw him as harrison carter on ``here's lucy.''
they were reunited briefly in 1986 for the short-lived ``life with lucy.''
gordon first met miss ball in 1947 on the radio program ``my favorite husband,'' which later became ``i love lucy'' on television.
``i thought she was a very good-looking young woman, and very talented,'' he recalled. ``she was very pleasant to work with. none of us knew what was going to happen _ television was very young then and it wasn't taken too seriously. we never dreamed it would ever become the power it was ... and the great stars it would produce.''
gordon last spoke to miss ball from edmonton on his birthday, feb. 20, when ``she called to wish me a happy birthday as she has done for years and years.''
gordon has done regular stints for years at a chain of edmonton-based dinner theatres called stage west. he is currently appearing with that company's mayfair dinner theatre as a priest in the play ``mass appeal.''
the play has another month to run and gordon says that means he won't be able to attend miss ball's funeral.
``i couldn't do that because it would put people out of work,'' he said. ``she would be the first one to scream her head off if i did that.''
