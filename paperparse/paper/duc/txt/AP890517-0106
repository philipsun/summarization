the senate foreign relations committee today endorsed the nomination of michigan republican activist peter f. secchia as ambassador to italy, but the panel's chairman said he feared secchia might ``embarrass the united states'' because of his ``penchant for making gross remarks.''
the committee's vote was 13-0 in favor of secchia, a former republican national committeeman for michigan and lumber industry executive.
the chairman, sen. claiborne pell, d-r.i., and sen. alan cranston, d-calif., voted ``present,'' meaning they took no position.
pell inserted into the hearing record newspaper accounts ``containing the distasteful specifics of mr. secchia's remarks.''
at his confirmation hearing earlier this month, secchia pledged to be far more careful as a diplomat in his use of colorful language than he had been in his different role as a political organizer and enthusiast.
but pell said he was unpersuaded.
``tact and careful speech are hallmarks of successful diplomats,'' pell said. ``mr. secchia has demonstrated that he would bring opposite qualities to the position of ambassador to italy.''
``italian friends of mine telephoned me from rome, aghast at the prospect of having mr. secchia represent the united states in their country,'' the chairman said.
``i believe that this nomination is a mistake, and in all likelihood mr. secchia will be an embarrasment to the administration and the united states,'' pell said.
but he said that since secchia is ``the president's choice'' he would not try to block the nomination or delay action on it.
