it's taken the devastation caused by hurricane hugo to stimulate repayment of a 211-year-old debt between two cities almost 1,000 miles apart.
as a way of repaying a kindness dating to 1778, kingston is raising money to help charleston, s.c., recover.
after kingston, then new york's capital, was burned in october 1777 by the british, new york gov. george clinton received a letter from south carolina gov. abraham livingston. the letter included nearly 1,000 new york pounds to help kingston residents get through their crisis.
``this money has been received for the charitable purpose of alleviating the distresses of the now-indigent inhabitants of the town of kingston, who by the ravages of the enemy are reduced to poverty and want,'' livingston wrote on march 31, 1778.
kingston historian edwin ford remembered the letter when hurricane hugo ravaged the carolinas last week. ``i figured they helped us, we should do something for them,'' ford said.
on wednesday, a local red cross chapter began collecting donations for victims of the hurricane.
``a lot of people have been calling, asking to send donations down there,'' said susan lawlor, executive director of the ulster county chapter of the red cross.
on tuesday, new york state sent two airplanes full of food, clothing and water to parts of the caribbean ravaged by hugo. a new york national guard c-5a cargo plane also left tuesday to pick up equipment in mississippi and take it to puerto rico.
another cargo plane was scheduled to leave stewart air force base in newburgh, taking 70 tons of food, water and other supplies to puerto rico.
