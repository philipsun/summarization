the drought may force the government to ease crop acreage controls next year to help the united states rebuild its grain inventories, agriculture secretary richard e. lyng said monday.
but the united states ``will continue to be a major player'' in world agriculture and in 1989 ``should be able to bounce back'' from this year's drought losses, he said.
lyng's remarks were prepared for delivery at a meeting of farm magazine, extension, advertising, co-op and broadcast editors.
a larger portion of the united states suffered from some degree of drought stress in may and june than at any point since records began in 1895, he said.
moreover, on july 2, about 35 percent of the contiguous united states was in the ``severe to extreme'' drought category, he said. in 1934, more than 60 percent was so rated, and in august 1954 more than 50 percent was in that category.
``because of the large early season area now experiencing drought in the u.s., 1988 appears to have the potential to approach or exceed the drought-affected areas of the 1930s and 1950s,'' lyng said.
even with the severe drought, there will be an adequate supply of food grains and livestock feed grains so that the united states ``will be able to take care of our domestic needs and our export demand,'' he said.
lyng said total consumption of 1988 crops will probably be somewhat less than previously estimated because prices are much higher.
``but it is important to note that we will have no shortages, that we will still be able to accommodate the needs of our overseas buyers,'' he said.
