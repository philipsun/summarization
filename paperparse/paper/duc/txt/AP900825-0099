ousted east german leader erich honecker will not stand trial in east germany as long as the formerly communist country exists, a west german newspaper reported.
the hamburg-based bild am sonntag said saturday that it would report in its sunday editions that honecker could be prosecuted in a united germany, however, for violation of property laws.
bild quoted guenter seidel, an east german prosecutor, as saying that honecker had used $42 million for stocking a private housing estate for leaders of the former communist government.
however, seidel said that the investigation was not far enough along to determine whether charges could be filed against honecker before east germany merges with west germany on oct. 3.
negotiators are still working out the merger of the two german legal systems.
honecker, 78, was ousted as east germany's leader on oct. 18, paving the way for the country's first freely elected government in march. honecker is in poor health and remains confined to a soviet military hospital in beelitz outside east berlin.
he is under investigation on allegations of abuse of power, corruption, harboring terrorists and issuing shoot-to-kill orders to prevent east germans from escaping to west germany when he served as the country's leader.
bild said that erich mielke, the ex-head of east germany's former secret police, was also unlikely to go to court in east germany.
``i am at the end. i am a dead man,'' bild quoted mielke, 82, as saying at his last interrogation.
