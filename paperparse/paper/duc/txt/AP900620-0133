the arrival wednesday of african national congress leader nelson mandela prompted an outpouring of praise and encouragement from politicians and supporters. a sampling of their comments:
the rev. jesse jackson: ``the presence of nelson mandela generates hope around the world. he emerged from the prison unbroken, unbowed and without bitterness, and he continues to struggle for human rights. just as the walls came down in berlin, they should come down in south africa as well.''
mayor david dinkins: ``our honored guest ... is a george washington, a bolivar, a king, a herzl. he is like a modern-day moses leading the people of south africa from enslavement at the hands of the pharaohs. he and his people have endured their walk through the desert of deprivation. and now, his path is clear. he will not be deterred. he and his people have suffered their way into the leadership of south africa.''
former tennis star arthur ashe: ``for me, one of my fondest dreams and hopes is to see nelson mandela free. i never thought i'd see the day. i feel humbled by being part of his welcome to our country. he will do more good here than he will ever, ever know.''
new york gov. mario cuomo: ``today we are celebrating nelson mandela and honoring his commitment to mankind. this government ought to continue to support the needs of south africa with its speeches, its prayers and its money.''
new jersey gov. jim florio: ``today is a restatement of our commitment that all people are created equal.''
