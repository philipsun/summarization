the san francisco 49ers' 55-10 rout of the denver broncos was the lowest-rated super bowl in 21 years and the third-lowest ever.
the game on cbs averaged a 39.0 rating and a 63 share, the lowest super bowl rating since 1969, when the new york jets' 16-7 victory over baltimore got a 36.0 on nbc for the worst rating ever, a.c. nielsen co. said today.
the rating is a percentage of the nation's televisions; each point represents 921,000 homes. the share is the percentage of the televisions on at the time.
despite the low rating, sunday's game was seen by about 108.5 million people, making it the ninth most-watched tv show ever in the united states behind eight super bowls and the final episode of ``mash.'' the higher viewership was made possible by the annual increase in the number of homes with television.
``given the expected blowout, the numbers are completely understandable and we're happy to have a 39,'' said susan kerr, director of programming for cbs sports. ``it's still a remarkable rating for prime time.''
the 49ers won by the biggest margin in super bowl history.
only the 1969 and 1968 super bowls had lower ratings; green bay's 33-14 victory over oakland in 1968 got a 36.8. the first super bowl was in 1967.
the highest-rated super bowl was in 1982, when the 49ers' 26-21 victory over cincinnati got a 49.1 on cbs.
last year's san francisco-cincinnati super bowl, won by the 49ers 20-16, got a 43.5 rating and was seen in 39.3 million homes, according to nielsen estimates. this year's game was seen in about 35.9 million homes.
viewership of the 5 p.m. game this year peaked at a 41.6 rating and a 69 share from 6 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., dropping off as it became clear that denver would not rally.
the pregame show got a 39.0 rating and a 63 share and the postgame show got a 22.5 rating and a 35 share.
the musical ``annie,'' which was on abc opposite the game, got a 9.4 rating. ``life goes on'' on nbc got a 6.0 rating and ``love with a twist'' on nbc a 7.6.
