[text] dushanbe 16 may tass -- the tajik communist party has called for the restoration of a renovated soviet union in the form of a federation as the only means to ensure the development of the political, economic, and spiritual potential of former soviet republics.
tajik communists' leader shodiy shabdolov told itar-tass on monday [16 may]that the disintegration of the soviet union and the parade of sovereignty that followed it have led to economic and political chaos in all republics. radical market reforms "imposed by quasi- democrats" and "wild privatisation" have enriched a small group of nouveau riches and plunged the rest of the population in poverty and hunger, he said.
the mass drive for sovereignty was accompanied by armed inter-ethnic conflicts in many ex-soviet republics and outburst of nationalism. tajikistan was hit most hard. the civil war in the republic claimed the lives of more than 100,000 people, shabdolov said.
he noted that the majority of the population support tajik communists' call for the restoration of the soviet union. over one million people, about two-thirds of the adult population, signed appeals "for unity, brotherhood and friendship of the peoples of the ussr" adopted by numerous conferences and meetings held all across the republic.
supporters of the restoration of a renovated union held a founding congress of their movement in dushanbe on saturday. apart from the communist party, the founders of the new movement include tajik trade unions, the union of tajik women, organisations of veterans and ethnic and cultural associations.
"we are confident that our movement is growing so strong that it cannot be stopped," shabdolov said. he stressed that it will act within the framework of the law and use only constitutional methods. "we are against barricades and use of force," he said.
