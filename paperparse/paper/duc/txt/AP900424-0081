jubilant astronomers saw decades of work take wing tuesday as the hubble space telescope was boosted high above earth to launch ``a great adventure for mankind.''
charles robert o'dell, a rice university space physicist who has worked 19 years on hubble, said seeing it hurled into orbit aboard the shuttle capped an experience that was ``comparable to raising a child. i've been with the program since it was a concept.
``there is nothing better than to see 19 years of my work and five of my friends thrust into orbit,'' he said.
colin norman, a physics and astronomy professor at johns hopkins university and academic affairs director of the space telescope science institute there, called the launch ``the perfect start to a great adventure for mankind.
``it was incredibly beautiful. the power of the launch was awesome and the telescope has an awesome power,'' norman said.
discovery's liftoff was especially gratifying since it ended seven years of delays. the $1.5 billion telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but remained grounded by technical problems and the challenger explosion.
two weeks ago when hundreds of scientists crowded into the kennedy space center, the launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff. only a few dozen of them returned tuesday, but they were just as excited.
``there were times when we were deeply depressed. there were times when we were elated'' about hubble's progress, said william h. jeffreys, a university of texas astronomer and hubble's astrometry project leader. jeffreys said. ``this is one of those times when we are thrilled beyond belief.''
ed weiler, nasa program scientist for hubble, said watching the liftoff was ``a double whammy'' because ``it was my first shuttle launch and the launch of the hst. it really gets to you.''
