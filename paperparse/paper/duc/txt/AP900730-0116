east germany's deposed communist leader erich honecker is too sick to be held in jail but is fit enough to be tried, the official news agency adn reported monday.
adn, quoting a health ministry statement, said honecker was still recovering from surgery for kidney cancer in january and was not well enough to be incarcerated.
but a medical exam by a team of doctors found him in condition to be questioned and to stand trial, adn said.
honecker, 77, ruled east germany for 19 years until he was ousted in october as a wave of pro-democracy demonstrations swept the country, leading to the peaceful overthrow of the communist government and the opening of the berlin wall.
the medical panel concluded that seven other former communist officials, who had been among honecker's closest aides, were all fit to prosecute and to be placed in custody, adn said.
it said former secret police chief erich mielke, former economics czar guenter mittag and former labor chief harry tisch were under arrest, while the other four remained free. all three had been members of the ruling politburo under honecker. mielke was arrested on thursday.
honecker and the seven are charged with corruption and abuse of office. they had been arrested soon after honecker's fall but were later released because of advanced age and poor health.
honecker has been staying at a soviet military hospital outside east berlin.
adn quoted federal prosecutor guenter seidel as saying he intended to continue his investigation against the former east german leaders, although their poor health often disrupted the proceedings.
