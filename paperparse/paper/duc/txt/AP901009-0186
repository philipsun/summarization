john lennon's worldwide message of peace was delivered tuesday as his song ``imagine'' was played simultaneously for 1 billion people in 130 countries to celebrate what would have been his 50th birthday.
``a dream we dream alone is only a dream, but the dream we dream together is reality. happy birthday, john. the world is better today for sharing a time with you,'' yoko ono said at a united nations ceremony before the playing of ``imagine.''
the slain former beatle himself issued a call for harmony in a taped message that served as an introduction to the music.
``we all want peace, whatever sort of job we have. ... think of your children. do you want them to be killed or don't you? and that's the choice we have in front of us. war or peace,'' said lennon, whose son sean turned 15 tuesday.
none of the other beatles were at the united nations, but a tribute came from lennon's old songwriting partner, paul mccartney, who released a live version of the beatles' tune ``birthday.'' the song, originally on the ``white album,'' was the first lennon-mccartney single released since the beatles broke up in 1969.
``the release date and john's birthday is just a happy coincidence, but it's also a nod and a wink to my old mate,'' said mccartney, 47.
other observances were held from liverpool to moscow to los angeles.
in lennon's hometown in england, fans gathered at the former site of the cavern club, where the beatles were discovered.
among those attending was lennon's 71-year-old uncle, charlie lennon.
when asked how his nephew would have reacted to the ceremonies, he said: ``if he had been alive i doubt he would have come and even if he had, he would sat with me in the pub and had a good laugh.''
on the west coast, about 50 people - part of an estimated 1 billion people worldwide who had access to the event - stood near lennon's star on the walk of fame and listened to the ``imagine'' broadcast:
``imagine all the people, living life in peace
``you may say i'm a dreamer, but i'm not the only one
``i hope some day you'll join us
``and the world will live as one.''
``his spirit still lives in all of us whose lives have been touched with him,'' ono said of her late husband.
``i would like us to remember and celebrate his birthday as a day of love, because he was a man of love, and because love is much needed at this time in our lives.''
ono was greeted by marcela perez de cuellar, wife of the u.n. secretary-general. during her brief remarks, ono also quoted a line from another of lennon's songs, ``happy xmas (war is over)'': ``remember, war is over if you want it.''
more than 1,000 radio stations and networks from 50 countries broadcast the 10-minute event. u.s. armed forces television and radio beamed it to 80-plus other countries. mtv televised the ``imagine'' video in 25 countries, said andrea smith, a spokeswoman for the network.
in moscow, about 1,000 soviets gathered at the moscow electrical lamp factory's cultural hall to listen to lennon's music, snap up his albums and posters and reflect on his life.
even the staid state television program ``vremya'' got into the act. an anchorman, reporting on the worldwide birthday bash, described ``imagine'' as an ``anthem of peace.'' the broadcast ended with an instrumental version of ``yesterday.''
not so long ago, the beatles' music was banned in the soviet union. in 1964, one commentator warned that ``these bugs can swiftly ignite the very darkest and primitive passions.''
lennon was shot to death by a deranged fan outside his manhattan apartment building on dec. 8, 1980.
