japanese writer kazuo ishiguro won the 1989 booker prize, britain's top literary award, for his novel ``the remains of the day,'' judges announced thursday.
the prize is worth $32,000.
judges praised the novel, a love story about a butler's english vacation, as ``a cunningly structured and beautifully paced performance.''
other finalists this year were canadian margaret atwood for ``cat's eye,'' irish author john banville for ``book of evidence,'' scotland's james kelman for ``a disaffection'' and english writers sybille bedford for ``jigsaw'' and rose tremain for ``restoration.''
after receiving the prize, ishiguro paid tribute to salman rushdie, the 1988 runner-up for the award, who went into hiding in february when he was threatened with death by moslems who said his novel ``the satanic verses'' blasphemed their faith.
``now that circumstances have changed, when perhaps it is inconvenient for many people to support his writing, i just felt it was fitting that we should not turn our backs on him,'' ishiguro said.
rushdie lives in england. ishiguro, 39, arrived in england at age 6 and now lives in south london. he writes in english.
in announcing the winner, the judges said: ```the remains of the day' renders with humor and pathos a memorable character and explores the large, vexed themes of class, tradition and duty. it was narrowly preferred but universally admired.''
ishiguro was a finalist for the booker prize in 1986 for his novel ``an artist of the floating world.''
the booker prize is sponsored by booker, an international food and agriculture business.
