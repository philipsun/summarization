with no seats and no food for the guests of honor, everyone agreed that lunch at sardi's had gone to the dogs.
two dogs, to be specific, the city's top police dog and the nation's top show dog.
the dog fanciers club organized the event wednesday to honor champion great elms prince charming ii, a fluffy little pomeranian, and nero, a big, amiable bruiser of a german shepherd.
``he's a very friendly dog,'' said nero's master, officer joseph faraguna. ``in all the arrests i've made with him, he's only bitten four times.''
nero specializes in sniffing out bombs and narcotics. he has helped the police department make hundreds of arrests and has ``apprehended'' more than 50 felons.
nero was kept on his long leather leash while prince emerged from his elegant, padded carrying case only long enough to pose for photographers.
the pomeranian was named best in show at the prestigious westminister kennel club show in madison square garden last month.
prince, long used to being coddled and primped, seemed oblivious to all the attention until nero grew bold enough to prod him on the chin. then he blinked and drew back.
but neither nero nor prince got any lunch from the luncheon at sardi's, a prominent midtown manhattan restaurant.
prince, said his agent and master skip piazza, ``doesn't have a very large diet anyway.''
