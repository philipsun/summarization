moslem extremists abducted a leading businessman and an educator friday and threatened to kill them, a day after authorities killed six militants crossing into pakistan for arms and training, police said.
roads were blocked around srinagar, where the hostages were seized, and soldiers tightened security around the kashmir valley, where the government launched a crackdown jan. 20 on the moslem separatist movement.
a telephone caller told a local reporter the abductors were also holding a third hostage and all three men would be killed within 24 hours of a monday afternoon deadline for releasing three jailed militants.
the caller claimed to speak for the students liberation front, a branch of the jammu-kashmir liberation front fighting for autonomy in the predominantly moslem state. india itself is overwhelmingly hindu.
police sources, who demanded anonymity, and the telephone caller both identified the new kidnap victims as vice chancellor mushir ul-haq of kashmir university and l.m. khela, general manager of hindustan machine tools co.
the caller said ul-haq's private secretary also was being held hostage, but that could not be confirmed.
moslem separatists had warned indian government officials to leave jammu-kashmir state before april or ``face the consequences.''
police said the border violence took place in kupwara district, where at least 20 separatists tried to sneak into neighboring pakistan to receive military training and buy weapons. no details were available.
india says pakistan trains and arms the militants in kashmir, at the far northern tip of india. pakistan denies it. india and pakistan have fought two wars over the region since 1947, when both nations won independence from britain.
