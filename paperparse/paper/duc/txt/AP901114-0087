on the stage where leonard bernstein made his sensational new york philharmonic conducting debut 47 years ago, the orchestra remembered the maestro at a concert that included selections from his ``mass'' and ``chichester psalms.''
wednesday's midday concert at carnegie hall also came on the 90th birthday of the late composer-conductor's close friend, aaron copland. and it was the 36th anniversary of the first tv broadcast by bernstein, who died oct. 16.
speakers, introducing various selections and often quoting from bernstein's writings, included bernstein's three children, son-in-law and friends lauren bacall and schuyler chapin.
bernstein's daughter jamie thomas said her father had loved numerical coincidences ``and today there's a flock of them.''
the concert began with selections from bernstein's ``mass,'' which he composed for the opening of the kennedy center for performing arts in washington, and ended with psalm 133, in hebrew, from bernstein's ``chichester psalms.''
conductors were michael tilson thomas, michael barrett, christoph eschenbach and james levine. the orchestra played the overture to bernstein's ``candide'' with a symbolically empty podium, which brought tears to some of the invited audience and a standing ovation.
cellist mstislav rostropovich played a bach sarabande. singers were the westminster choir, mezzo-sopranos marilyn horne and christa ludwig, soprano clamma dale, tenor jerry hadley and baritones thomas hampson and chester ludgin.
first chair musicians from the boston symphony, israel philharmonic, london symphony, santa cecilia orchestra and vienna philharmonic flew here, at their orchestras' expense, to take part.
two pieces by copland were played. the concert also included schumann, haydn and mahler as well as excerpts from six bernstein works.
bernstein was the new york philharmonic's 25-year-old assistant conductor on nov. 14, 1943, when he filled in at the last minute for an ailing bruno walter.
