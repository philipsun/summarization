ethnic violence killed 148 people and wounded 885 this month in the central asian republic of kirghizia, the official news agency tass said wednesday.
tass said 748 of the injured had to be hospitalized and said a search was continuing for a police officer who vanished june 7.
no new outbreaks were reported in the region near the border city of osh in western kirghizia, where clashes arising from a land dispute began on june 2 between ethnic kirghiz and uzbeks, both sunni moslems.
the argument involves allocation of land in a densly populated region where housing is scarce. it was the latest in a series of bloody civil conflicts to trouble president mikhail s. gorbachev's government.
maj. gen. alexander grienko, chief of the interior ministry's political department, said that in two years of civil strife _ mainly ethnic clashes _ in the soviet union, about 24,000 people have been arrested.
he said in moscow on tuesday that ministry troops had to be used in 13 regions of the soviet union because of such outbreaks, tass said.
grienko said 16 ministry soldiers were killed, four were reported missing and more than 1,000 wounded. tass did not quote grienko on how civilians casualties.
the general was quoted as saying these conflicts ``were often accompanied by riots and pogroms, arson and massacre of innocent people, (and) complete or partial destabilization of the situation.''
besides unrest this month in kirghizia and uzbekistan, ethnic violence also has been reported in recent years in georgia, armenia, azerbaijan, kazakhstan and tadzhikistan.
