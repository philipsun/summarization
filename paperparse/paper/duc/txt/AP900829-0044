enrile said he was willing to reconcile with mrs. aquino, who fired him as defense minister after he was implicated in a coup attempt in november 1986.

defense secretary fidel ramos has adamantly refused any cease-fire with the communist guerrillas since november 1986 when the aquino government negotiated with the rebels during a 60-day truce.
ramos, a member of the cabinet committee, has been credited with crushing six coup attempts against mrs. aquino.
communists have accused him of whipping up threats of another coup attempt against mrs. aquino so that the civilian leadership would become indebted to him. ramos has denied all allegations.
the last cease-fire with the rebels collapsed in january 1987 after troops fired on farmers demonstrating outside mrs. aquino's office for land reform.
