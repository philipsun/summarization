six novels have been nominated for the booker prize, britain's most prestigious fiction award, and bookmakers say the favorite is ``the remains of the day'' by japanese author kazuo ishiguro.
the award, to be announced oct. 26, carries a $31,600 prize funded by the booker mcconnell food company.
oddsmaker william hill gave 7-to-4 odds on ishiguro's novel about a butler's travels through britain's west country and said it was ``a firm favorite'' to win.
ishiguro, previously nominated for the award, ``was beaten as the booker favorite in 1986, which makes his chances that much stronger this time in our view,'' said william hill spokesman graham sharpe.
the other books nominated are:
_ ``cat's eye,'' a story of painter elaine risley and her return to her childhood home in toronto by canadian author margaret atwood, also a previous nominee.
_ ``the book of evidence,'' a prison story of kidnap and murder convict freddie montgomery by john banville, literary editor of the irish times newspaper.
_ ``jigsaw,'' by sybille bedford, an autobiographical novel about an adolescent's travels through germany, italy and france.
_ ``a disaffection,'' scottish novelist james kelman's story about a school teacher, patrick doyle, whose professional frustrations are fueled by a drinking problem and unrequited love for a colleague.
_ ``restoration,'' british author rose tremain's story of robert merivel, a favorite of king charles ii who married the monarch's youngest mistress.
``we expect more interest in this year's booker prize than ever before, partly thanks to last year's controversy over salman rushdie's `satanic verses,''' sharpe said.
rushdie was nominated for the prize last year but it was won by australian author peter carey for his love story ``oscar and lucinda.''
rushdie, a british citizen, has been in hiding since feb. 14 when the late iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini ordered he be killed for allegedly blaspheming islam in ``satanic verses.''
this year's six nominees were chosen thursday from 102 books considered by a panel headed by david lodge, a british literary critic and novelist who was nominated for the prize last year for his book, ``nice work.''
