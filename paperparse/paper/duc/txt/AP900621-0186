the earthquake that devastated iran early thursday took tens of thousands of lives because people were asleep in fragile homes built on flood plains, an earthquake expert said.
``most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something falling on top of you,'' said russ needham, a geophysist with the u.s. geological survey that monitors ground motion around the world.
the quake hit at 12:30 a.m. in iran, when most of the people were in their homes, needham said thursday in a telephone interview from golden, colo.
at least 25,000 people died and thousands were injured in the quake, which demolished scores of villages and buried thousands of people in the rubble of their homes, iranian officials said.
needham said most structures in that area are built of a ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily.
``it's very similar to what we had in armenia,'' he said of the dec. 7, 1988, earthquake that killed about 25,000 people.
a soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings.
the armenian quake was measured at 6.9 on the richter scale, but thursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 7.7.
the shock wave traveled through the mountainous section of coastal iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse, he said.
the 7.7-magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that area, where two major plates of the earth's crust meet, needhams said.
``iran is in a very active seismic region,'' he said, and that there have been many smaller quakes.
twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude 7 have occurred in iran during the last 30 years, needhams said.
a quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.
