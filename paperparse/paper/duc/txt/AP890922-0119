while hurricane hugo's 135 mph wind roared outside, mayor joseph p. riley jr. watched the fury it vented on his beloved, 300-year-old city.
riley, city officials and a few reporters stayed in charleston's historic city hall through thursday night as the area's worst hurricane in three decades pounded the coastal city where the civil war began.
late in the day, there was hope hugo might spare charleston. but the storm gathered strength and speed as it spun straight toward this city, which had survived a number of near misses from great storms in recent years.
from the moment it became apparent hugo might strike the southeast coast, many charlestonians conceded that, this time, their number was up.
as hugo's wind howled outside the plywood boards protecting the windows, reporters wandered in and out of riley's office. on his desk several candles burned as insurance against the inevitable loss of power.
later there was a sharp crack as a piece of the tin roof ripped off and water seeped down on the burnished wood tables in the city council chamber. phone and electric service to the city command post was knocked out.
during it all, riley kept in close contact with the national weather service. as the eye of the storm passed, he took reporters onto the porch of the 188-year-old brick city hall to look at the damage.
the initial view, sketched out in the glow of flashlights, was unsettling: the tin roof was tossed in the gutter, slate tiles were scattered on the ground. bricks, sticks and leaves littered the street.
``this is the eye of the hurricane. i've never been in one and i hope i'm never in one again,'' riley said. ``it's scarcely a late summer breeze.''
as the storm died before dawn, riley was out on the streets again in a raincoat carrying a flashlight to get a better assessment of the damage.
``serious but fixable,'' the mayor concluded.
