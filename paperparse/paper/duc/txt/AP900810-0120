east germany authorities on friday interrogated former communist leader erich honecker about his role in the killings of people who tried to flee the country.
honecker and erich mielke, head of east germany's once-feared secret police agency, were interrogated by federal prosecutors, said peter przybylski, a justice ministry spokesman.
more than 200 people were shot to death or killed by land mines as they tried to escape from east germany's communist rule.
the government announced in june that honecker, mielke and several border guards would be investigated on possible murder charges in connection with those deaths.
honecker, 77 and in failing health, and several other members of his ousted regime already have been charged with corruption and abuse of power.
the murder charge could put honecker behind bars for life, but his poor health makes prosecution questionable. he is staying in a soviet hospital outside berlin.
last month, a medical panel ruled that honecker was too ill to be jailed pending investigation but fit enough to be prosecuted.
mielke was ordered jailed.
east germany's democratic government has changed its mind several times on whether to pursue charges against the aging members of the former hard-line regime that was toppled in last autumn's pro-democracy protests.
