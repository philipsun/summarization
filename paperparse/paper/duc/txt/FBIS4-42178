[text] berlin -- erich honecker, the former gdr head of state, died at his house in santiago, chile on sunday morning [29 may], according to his lawyer. lawyer nicolas becker, who had represented 81-year-old honecker before the berlin court in 1992 and early 1993, told dpa on sunday afternoon that honecker had rejected an operation. however, everything that was sensible had been done with regard to his cancer.
becker could not comment on the exact cause of honecker's death. his colleague, wolfgang ziegler, had said earlier that the former most powerful man in the gdr had obviously died from his liver cancer.
becker said he did not know whether honecker has left a will or where the funeral would be held. this will be decided by the family.
he also said he cannot say whether margot honecker, who had informed becker of her husband's death, will be allowed to stay in chile. after being released from prison in 1993, honecker had traveled to santiago to join his daughter, who is married to a chilean. since then, he and his wife had been living in a house in a wealthy santiago area.
