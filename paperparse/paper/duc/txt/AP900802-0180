the invasion: iraq's troops, led by about 350 tanks, crossed the border at dawn thursday, and seized the kuwaiti palace and government buildings 40 miles away. early friday, the invaders controlled kuwait city, the capital. the soldiers were also making sweeps through the southern oilfields, according to residents and lloyds' insurance service in london. diplomatic sources estimate more than 200 kuwaitis were killed or wounded, mainly from the emiri guard which bore the main brunt of the invasion. kuwait's sheik saad al-abdullah al-sabah fled to safety in saudi arabia.

the forces: iraq, a country of more than 17 million, has the arab world's most battle-trained army, and had massed more than 100,000 soldiers on the kuwaiti border. kuwait, an oil-rich city-state, has 1.9 million residents _ 60 percent foreigners _ and an army of 20,300 soldiers.

cause of conflict: president saddam hussein of iraq accused kuwait of stealing oil from its territory and forcing down oil prices through overproduction. kuwait and u.n. diplomats dismissed iraq's claim that it invaded at the request of kuwaiti revolutionaries.

reaction: the u.n. security council voted 14-0 to condemn the invasion.
president bush denounced it as ``naked agression.'' he froze iraq's assets in the united states and blocked almost all iraqi imports, including oil. the order also froze kuwait property under u.s. jurisdiction _ a move intended to keep iraq from seizing it.
the soviets also condemned the invasion and stopped arms sales to iraq.
kuwait's u.s. ambassador said the nation had asked for american military intervention.
a pentagon source said a u.s. naval group was diverted toward the persian gulf.
oil prices soared in frenzied trading amid fears the invasion would reduce the supply of oil.
