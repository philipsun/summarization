<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>According to a study published in the journal Science, cardiac cell damage following a heart attack may be limited by a natural substance called transforming growth factor beta.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In studies with rats induced to have heart attacks, those rats receiving injections of TGF beta had 50 percent less cell damage than those not receiving the injections.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>TGF beta is normally present in heart cells but is missing from rat heart cells damaged by the simulated heart attack.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The extent of heart cell damage was determined by measuring the amount of creatine kinase in the heart tissue.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Hearts damaged by a heart attack tended to lose creatine kinase.</a>
