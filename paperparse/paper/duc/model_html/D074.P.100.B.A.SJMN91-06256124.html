<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As Senate hearings on Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court continue, there appears to be no groundswell of opposition to his confirmation although Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have criticized the candidate's refusal to answer some questions and his reply when asked his view on abortion: "Whether or not I have a view is irrelevant".</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The committee's 14 members seem to break down into three groups: 5 Republicans solidly for Thomas; 6 Democrats in opposition; and three swing votes, one Republican and two Democrats.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Thomas is expected to continue testifying through Friday and the committee will hear from other witnesses next week.</a>
