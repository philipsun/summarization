<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In December 1993 the Foreign Ministers of Russia and The United Kingdom spoke out about the seriousness and the consequences of the ethnic and political conflicts in the former Soviet Union.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>They agreed that the disputes are a legitimate concern of Russians who are concerned about clashes close to their borders, and about the welfare of ethnic Russians living within the borders of the now independent states that had been part of the Soviet Union.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Europe and the entire international community should share those concerns for humanitarian reasons and because continuing conflicts risk promoting regional instability and threats to European security.</a>
