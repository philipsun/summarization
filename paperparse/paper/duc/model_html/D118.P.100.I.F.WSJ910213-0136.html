<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Granting that Tower often rubs people the wrong way and earlier had "boozed it up and fooled around", the editorial says that the recent charges of drinking, womanizing, and services for defense industry clients have not the "least substance".</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Tower accuses Senator Nunn and others of using FBI queries to discredit him and to put the confirmation process on a personal basis.</a>
