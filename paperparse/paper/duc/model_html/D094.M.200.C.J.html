<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Emperor Hirohito, who died on January 7 of cancer after several months of internal bleeding, left a taxable estate of approximately $13 million.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Posthumously named Showa, or Enlightened Peace, the name of his reign, Hirohito will be remembered for his most courageous decision in his 62-year reign: Japan must surrender and end the Pacific conflict in WW II.</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The show also claims that President Truman decided not to prosecute Hirohito for war crimes, and Japan's wartime prime minister, Gen.Tojo, was pressured into changing his testimony to avoid incriminating the emperor.</a>
