<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Checkpoint Charlie, the most famous symbol of the Cold War was lifted into history today.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>At an invitation only ceremony attended by the foreign ministers of the four World War II allies, a U.S. army band played an old Berlin song as the checkpoint was hoisted onto a waiting flatbed truck, to be taken to a museum.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Speaking at the ceremony, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit Berlin, called for the removal of Berlin's status as an allied controlled city and the withdrawal of troops six months after the two German states unify.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Secretary of State James Baker, citing Checkpoint Charlie's status as a Cold War symbol, expressed the hope that its removal would bury the conflicts it created.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The decision to remove Checkpoint Charlie came as large sections of the wall were being dismantled and the opening of the border between the two Berlins made the checkpoint superfluous.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Its removal was timed to coincide with a meeting of German and Allied foreign ministers in East Berlin to discuss the status of Berlin and a united Germany.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Among the invited guests was West Germany's Chancellor Willy Brandt who was mayor of Berlin in the 1960s.</a>
