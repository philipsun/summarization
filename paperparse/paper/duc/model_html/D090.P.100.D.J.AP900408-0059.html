<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Thursday Secretary-designate Florencio Abad, whose nomination was opposed by the pro-Aquino Struggle of the Democratic Filipino Party, resigned.</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Abad's difficulties began in February when he tried unsuccessfully to block the lease of government land to Japan's Marubeni Corp., for an industrial park, believing the land should be distributed instead to peasants.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Abad's stand, alarmed landowners in Congress, and lawmakers on the Commission on Appointments who belong to the pro-Aquino party blocked his appointment through eight hearings.</a>
