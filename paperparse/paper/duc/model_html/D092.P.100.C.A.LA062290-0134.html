<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Iranian news media reacted sluggishly Thursday to an earthquake that left 25,000 dead in northern Iran.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For hours the only detailed reporting by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) was that Tehran residents were either asleep or watching a World Cup soccer match when the quake hit.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>IRNA also underestimated the severity of the quake reporting 10,000 dead late Thursday while the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations said 25,000 had died.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Official radio was off the air when the quake hit and only reported the earthquake 6.5 hours later.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Like IRNA radio reporting lacked color and description for hours.</a>
