<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>According to an official of the American Insurance Service Group, "Hugo will be the biggest hurricane loss on record".</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., for example, estimates it will pay clams totaling more than $400 million.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Nationwide Insurance Co. said claims could total $100 million.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Analysts, however, say most companies have sufficient funds to cover the losses and premium rate increases could be minimal.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Insurers also buy protection for themselves by paying another company a portion of the premium to bear some of the losses--called reinsurance.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>An investment analyst said losses from Hugo could temporarily increase reinsurance rates.</a>
