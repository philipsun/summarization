<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>True, world records can be established elsewhere, such as at the World University or the World Cup games.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>But consider, in the 1988 Summer Olympics from Seoul, Korea, at least one billion people, via a 115-nation worldwide TV hookup, watched more than 9,000 athletes from 160 countries compete.</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The 1988 summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea gave us the first meeting between Soviet Union and United States competitors since 1976.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The Soviets captured most medals, the U.S. third most.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>However, among those "third-most" U.S. competitors were superstar gold medalists Greg Louganis, Florence Griffith Joyner and Jackie Joyner- Kersee.</a>
