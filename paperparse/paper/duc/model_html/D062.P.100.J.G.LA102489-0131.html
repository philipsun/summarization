<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The governor is wrong, however, in distancing himself from the California Department of Transportation (Caltran) concerning what caused the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland to collapse.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The governor, claiming he wasn't told that a freeway might collapse in an earthquake, may be defending his opposition to a gasoline tax increase that could have funded highway development.</a>
