<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>John Tower of Texas served in the US Senate for 24 years, retiring in 1985.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>President-elect George Bush named him to be Secretary of Defense.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Just before Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearings began, Tower had surgery for the removal of a benign colon polyp.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Initially, members of the committee and early witnesses had praise for the former senator.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, later testimony suggested that Tower was a heavy drinker and womanizer.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Tower conceded that years earlier he had problems with alcohol, but said those days were behind him.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Questions continued to surface that those days were not that long ago.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The FBI was lax in investigating those recent incidents.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>An editorial supporting Tower conceded that he had earlier "boozed it up and fooled around" but said that recent charges did not have substance.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Tower's testimony that he had not dealt in defense matters when on the payroll of British Aerospace contradicted an earlier deposition in which he said he did just that.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The committee, controlled by Democrats, voted 11-9 against recommending rejection of Tower.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The full Senate rejected Tower 53-47, with one Republican against him and three Democrats for him.</a>
