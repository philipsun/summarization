<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Women's-rights activists dislike her opposition to comparable-worth legislation, religious groups are uncomfortable with her anti-cult activities, and some blacks feel the Thomases' marriage shows his rejection of the black community.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Supporters reply that the Thomases believe women and minorities are hindered, not helped, by affirmative action and government programs and their marriage is a reflection of the couple's belief in a colorblind society.</a>
