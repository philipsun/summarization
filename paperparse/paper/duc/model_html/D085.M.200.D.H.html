<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Supercomputers at the National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Maryland sent satellite information on Hugo's progress to the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Florida.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>There, forecasters aided by a computerized tracking model and Air Force reconnaissance planes that flew into the storm monitored Hugo's progress.</a>
