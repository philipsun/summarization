<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>They are now the third party nationally.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Some anti-John Major Conservatives are happy about the defeat.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Propelled to power by Margaret Thatcher who expected to continue her program discretely, Major is a weak leader.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Though some pushed him to pursue new "leftist" policies, Major vacillates to the left and to the right, producing a "crisis of honor".</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>He lacks vision, is incompetent on domestic and international issues, and is a political blunderer.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The Tories will make him a scapegoat for their defeat at the polls.</a>
