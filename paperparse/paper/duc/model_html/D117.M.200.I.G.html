<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>America has the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the National Book Awards but in terms of hoopla and excitement, there's nothing akin to Britain's Booker Prize.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>British publishers each submit three new titles for a total of approximately 100.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>There's a jury of judges, including writers, academics, politicians, editors and critics.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Each juror reads every book and odds are given with reviews.</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Literary insiders bet on which book will win the Booker Prize.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The winner is announced at a banquet in London's Elizabethan Guildhall, the seat the city's Lord Mayor, on the last Thursday in October.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The authors can win up to $38,000.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The event also guarantees great prestige and sales for the winner and brings the novel to public attention.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Critics say the brouhaha distorts the annual fiction industry and the intense media hype does a disservice to other gifted but unlisted authors.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>On one recent occasion following heated deliberation between the judges, the chairman went public with a rousing condemnation of contemporary fiction.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The Prize, first awarded in 1969, is administered by Book Trust, an educational charity promoting books.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>It is sponsored by Booker, an international food and farming business.</a>
