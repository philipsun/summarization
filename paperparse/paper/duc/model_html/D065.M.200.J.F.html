<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>George Bush's choice of Indiana Senator Dan Quayle as his running mate, surprised most political observers.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Despite service in Congress and Senate, he was looked upon as lacking the experience and mettle for a vigorous national campaign.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Several Republican senators rallied support.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Senator John Warner of Virginia compared Quayle to Thomas Jefferson.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Senator Bob Dole in nominating Quayle at the Republican Convention, called him a dedicated public servant and devoted family man and cited his support for the Reagan program.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Devotion to family and friends was a theme voiced by those who had known Quayle for many years.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Relatives and friends believed that if Quayle were elected, he and his family would remain a strong unit.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Questions arose regarding Quayle's fitness for the job, and there were some suggestions that he should withdraw.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>He had called himself a "Vietnam-era veteran" which angered some actual combat veterans.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Quayle's service was in the National Guard, a position he apparently gained through family influence.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Quayle's resume contained a reference to a position held in Indiana, two years before it was created.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Quayle survived these criticisms but did not play a strong role in the campaign or as vice president.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Friends, especially those in his hometown, remained loyal.</a>
