<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The earthquake that struck Iran reminded a US geophysicist of the 1988 quake in Armenia.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The Iran quake was of magnitude 7.7 while the Armenian was 6.9 but both killed about 25,000 persons and for essentially the same reasons: most victims were in houses that were shoddily built or otherwise fragile and could collapse easily.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The death toll in Iran was high because it happened at night when most people were asleep.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This quake was the strongest ever recorded in Iran, which is in a very active seismic region and has recorded 12 quakes of magnitude 7 in the past 30 years.</a>
