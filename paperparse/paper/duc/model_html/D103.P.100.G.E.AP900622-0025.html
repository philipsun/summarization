<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It is the largest quake ever recorded in that area, striking an area where most buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The soil shifts in an earthquake which caused the fragile ceramic-type brick or adobe homes to collapse easily.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The casualty count was pushed up because the quake struck just after midnight, when people were indoors asleep.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Thursday's quake was reminiscent of the Dec. 7, 1988 quake which devastated Soviet Armenia.</a>
