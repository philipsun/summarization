<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>He then planned to raise $448 million through the sale of shares in his Mirror Group Newspaper Ltd. of Britain.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>He bought Mirror Group in 1984 and turned it into one of Britain's most profitable newspaper groups.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A year after the Daily News purchase, he was found dead in the waters off the Canary Island where he was vacationing on his yacht.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Investigators say Maxwell siphoned money from his companies in an attempt to deal with crushing debts.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Some $630 million was taken from his Mirror Group pension fund without authority.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>His sons Kevin and Ian, who took over the business, were investigated and found guilty for their knowledge of illegal schemes using two Swiss trusts, a private UK trust company and a US investment bank to support the Maxwell Communications Company (MCC).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In a flurry of foreign exchange deals, the MCC would buy currency in one financial center promising, but often failing, to make payment in another center; thus getting an unauthorized loan.</a>
