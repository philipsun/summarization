<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The shortlist of six for the #20,000 Booker Prize for fiction prompted the publishing industry to comment that some on the list "are B-team writers at best" and that others "don't make the grade".</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This is surprising commentary given it is a bumper year for new fiction fulfilling the criteria--English language and non-American.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>There was some traditional controversy when it was revealed that an author whose novel had made the longlist was actually the wife of a Booker judge.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>But critics say it's the final list, not the controversy, which must have a final death blow to the Booker.</a>
