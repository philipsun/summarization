<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Soviet physicists, in a rebuff to the Soviet Union's scientific establishment, voted on Friday to nominate Andrei Sakharov to be a candidate in the March parliamentary elections.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The overwhelming vote, taken in secrecy, came only two days after the Governing Board of the Academy of Sciences rejected Sakharov's candidacy.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The vote was more an expression of respect for Sakharov than a specific endorsement of his political views.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Sakharov used the occasion to outline a detailed program that would transform the Soviet Union.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Complicated voting procedures still make it uncertain that Sakharov's name will appear on the ballot.</a>
