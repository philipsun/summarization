<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A West German newspaper reported that ousted East German leader Erich Honecker will not stand trial in East Germany as long as the formerly Communist country exists, although he could be prosecuted in a united Germany for violation of property laws.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Honecker allegedly used $42 million for stocking a private housing estate for Communist government leaders.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, the investigation is not far enough along to determine whether charges would be filed against Honecker before the East German-West German merger.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>He is under investigation for abuse of power, corruption, harboring terrorists, and issuing shoot-to-kill orders against East Germans escaping to West Germany.</a>
