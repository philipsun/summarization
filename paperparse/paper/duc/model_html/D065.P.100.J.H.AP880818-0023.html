<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Republicans compare vice-presidential nominee-designate Dan Quayle to Thomas Jefferson because he has "the same fire in his belly" and to John F. Kennedy because they would be relatively the same age when running for office.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Also, Quayle would have 12 years in the House and Senate compared to Kennedy's 14, and he is rich.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The media's comparison of him to Robert Redford, another blond, is a stigma for Quayle.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In 1980 Redford demanded he stop the look-alike references in his congressional campaign literature.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Quayle, 41, hasn't had a chance to become a legend, but will send a message that the Republican Party respects young people who achieve.</a>
