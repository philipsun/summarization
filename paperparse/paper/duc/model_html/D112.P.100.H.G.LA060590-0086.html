<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>British media entrepreneur Robert Maxwell, who publishes Britain's Daily Mirror, said Monday he is involved in negotiations to buy a U.S. newspaper worth "hundreds of millions of dollars".</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The newspaper was not identified but there is speculation that it might be The New York Daily News, which is struggling to restore profitability; USA Today, which would mesh with Maxwell's efforts for the new paper The European; or the Chicago Sun-Times that has been sliding in circulation since 1985.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Officials of each of these newspapers denied they were negotiating with Maxwell, who recently bought three US tabloids: the Globe, National Examiner, and the Sun.</a>
