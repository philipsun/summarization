<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Senate confirmation hearings for President Bush's nominees for ambassadorships have shown mixed results for the administration.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Some nominees like Shirley Temple Black the designated ambassador to Czechoslovakia, sailed through the process.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The nominees for Spain, Switzerland, Australia, and New Zealand faced strong questioning during Senate committee hearings but were eventually slimly approved.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Democrats and retired diplomats believed that three of the nominees had no real qualifications but were picked because of large money contributions to the Republican Party.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Democrats also had concern about the nominee to be ambassador to Italy.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Senator Jesse Helms and other conservatives objected to one nominee because he was a Democrat and were thought likely to have such strong objections to another that her name was withdrawn.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>That woman was initially picked to be ambassador to Nicaragua since that country was to install a woman as president but the potential objections led to a seasoned Latin American expert being named.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The administration picked Thomas Pickering, the ambassador to the UN to be ambassador to India.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This selection of a well-known diplomat underscores the administration concern regarding the Indian subcontinent where India and Pakistan, both now nuclear capable, continue to feud over Kashmir.</a>
