<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In the recent San Francisco earthquake, why did some luxury four-story apartments or office buildings collapse while high-rises escaped virtually unscathed?</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Accordingly, some buildings collapsed because of two things: very poor soil and very poor structural design.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Some were built over landfill and others were erected earlier when there were no earthquake codes.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Four-story buildings with garages underneath have no walls on one side.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Connections break and the front falls.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Skyscrapers usually survive because architects factor in wind gusts and earth movement.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In smaller buildings, contractors make sure that vertical forces--such as snow and ice--cannot force a collapse.</a>
