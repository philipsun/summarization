<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Some of those on the list were characterized as "B-Team Writers at the Best".</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This is surprising in a year of good works of fiction that meet the criteria for Booker consideration in that they are written in English and are non- American.</a>
