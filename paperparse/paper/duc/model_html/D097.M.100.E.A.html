<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>On Sept. 21, 1989 Hurricane Hugo hit Charleston, South Carolina head-on with winds at 135 mph causing extensive property damage, but claiming only 17 lives in all of South Carolina and only two in Charleston itself.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The relatively low casualties were a result of an accurate prediction of the point of windfall by hurricane forecasters, effective evacuation measures and good response from residents.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Total insured losses from Hugo were estimated near $5 billion, by far the costliest storm to ever hit the area, but insurers expressed confidence in being able to satisfy all claims.</a>
