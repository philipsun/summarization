<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To predict the path, supercomputers use satellite data to make constantly changing predictions.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Forecasters analyze the predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path to make an educated guess about the landfall.</a>
