<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>An earthquake hit Gilan and Zanjan provinces in northwestern Iran on June 21, 1990 killing at least 50,000 people, injuring 200,000 and leaving 400,000 homeless.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The quake measured 7.7 on the Richter scale and exacted particularly heavy casualties since it occurred when most people were inside asleep and hit a coastal area of loosely deposited soil that shifts, causing the ceramic-type brick or adobe homes in the area to collapse.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani appealed for international aid and the response was impressive with financial contributions and relief supplies arriving from the Soviet Union, Mexico, the Vatican, West Germany, Turkey, Spain, India, Austria, France and the United States.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The aid from the United States, channeled through the Red Cross and Red Crescent and including funds and supplies raised by Iranians in California, was the first benevolence offered by the U.S. and accepted by the Iranian government since the hostage crisis of 1979-80.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Iranian news media reacted sluggishly to the emergency, underestimating casualties and giving little detailed or colorful reporting for hours after the quake hit.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In Washington Iranian opposition leaders blamed the excessive casualties on the Iranian government and in Iran an anti-American newspaper blamed the United States.</a>
