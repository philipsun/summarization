<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>On Wednesday, Discovery's robot arm grasped the $1.5 billion, 12-ton Hubble Space Telescope, NASA's most expensive unmanned spacecraft, and hoisted it into space.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>After problems in unfurling a solar panel array were overcome, Discovery backed away and parked in orbit 46 miles behind.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For six hours, ground controllers tried to make contact with Hubble's two high-gain antennas, finally doing so by nearly doubling the antenna's beam width, to 10.8 degrees.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The problem was incorrect pointing of either Hubble or the TDRS, an orbiting communications satellite.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Today the telescope will be tested for maneuverability before the aperture door is opened Friday to expose the mirror to starlight.</a>
