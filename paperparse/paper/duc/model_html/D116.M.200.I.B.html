<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Following an aborted first try, the shuttle Discovery soared into space to launch its history-making payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Named after the American astronomer Edwin Hubble who did pioneering work leading to the "Big Bang" concept of the universe, it is NASA's most expensive spacecraft.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>While orbiting at 380 statute miles above Earth during its expected 15-year working lifetime, it will provide astronomers world-wide with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Free of Earth's distorting atmosphere, it may be able to look back almost to the beginning of time.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The telescope's release from the shuttle Discovery came two hours and one orbit later than planned.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A troublesome solar power panel took three tries before it fully unfurled, causing the delay.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Two Mission Specialists astronauts were standing-by to unfurl the panel manually if necessary.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Then more start-up problems, ground controllers were unable to link up the telescope's two high-gain antennas with their assigned relay satellite.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A weaker back-up antenna system is working.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The telescope was placed on special flight modes until these start-up problems are resolved.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Confident that the Hubble will soon be operational, the shuttle Discovery is preparing to return home.</a>
