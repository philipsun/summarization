<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>These attacks struck at the heart of India's commerce, seemingly aimed at undermining government efforts to expand foreign investment and tourism.</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The BSE was able to resume limited trading on Monday and the index rose for two days.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This rise was halted by an explosion Wednesday, which killed 45 and injured a score in a central Calcutta apartment complex.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Fears abound that communal strife will return.</a>
