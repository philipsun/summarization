<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope left the shuttle Discovery's cargo bay on Wednesday, nearly two hours and one orbit late, for orbit 380 statute miles above the earth's distorting atmosphere.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It took three attempts to deploy the telescope's second solar array panel, thus causing the delayed release from Discovery to operational orbit.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Suited astronauts were standing by to manually unfurl the solar panels if necessary.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Next, after first testing the telescope's maneuverability, the 10-foot aperture door will be opened on Friday, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight.</a>
