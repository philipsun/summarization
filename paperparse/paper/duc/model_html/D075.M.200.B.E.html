<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>New medicines such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF) and calcium channel blockers such as Diltiazem and Verapamil, when administered shortly after a heart attack have reduced both the heart damage of the attack as well as the likelihood of a second attack.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Even the simple aspirin, taken every other day has been shown to significantly reduce the chances of a first heart attack, especially when used in combination clot dissolving drugs.</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Aspirin may increase the chances of stroke in people with blood clotting problems or high blood pressure.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Surgical techniques, such as balloon angioplasty or partial ileal bypass surgery also show promise in lowering the incidence of a second heart attack.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Caution has been advised with angioplasty since it appears to be no more effective that clot-busting drugs in reducing the chances of a second heart attack.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Releasing the patient from the hospital as soon as possible, often within three days, also has a positive effect on recovery.</a>
