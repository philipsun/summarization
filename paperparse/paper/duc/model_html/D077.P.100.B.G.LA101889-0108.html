<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>I was sitting in a trailer outside the stadium when the earthquake hit.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>I looked out and the stadium was shaking.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A special concrete joint on top of the stadium was opening and closing like cardboard.</a>
