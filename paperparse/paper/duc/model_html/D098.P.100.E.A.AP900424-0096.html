<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has arrived seven years late where it belongs: aboard the shuttle Discovery orbiting 380 miles above Earth.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It was supposed to be launched in 1983, but technical problems and the Challenger accident delayed its deployment.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The telescope has two mirrors, two cameras, two spectrometers, a photometer, and a fine pointing system providing precise measurement of distances.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>On Wednesday a Discovery astronaut will operate the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 12-ton HST out of the cargo bay and drop it overboard to orbit on its own.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Scientists have hailed the HST as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo.</a>
