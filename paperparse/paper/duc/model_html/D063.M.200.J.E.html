<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A barracks at the Royal Marine Music School in Deal was leveled in an explosion on Friday, which killed 10 persons and injured 22 others, 12 seriously.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Responsibility for the blast was claimed by the Irish Republican Army, which said the attack was in response to a recent speech made by Prime Minister Thatcher to the Ulster Defense Regiment.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Calling the speech an "act of war," the IRA said such attacks would continue until the British withdrew their forces from Northern Ireland and allow a unification of the protestant Northern Ireland with the Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The explosion, which could be heard two miles away, came at 8:30 in the morning, just as the musicians were taking a coffee break.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Destroying the barracks, it also severely damaged a number of neighborhood homes, causing minor injuries among their residents.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Neighbors of the barracks as well as opposition politicians blamed the use of private security firms, which, they say, caused the security at the base to be lax.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Defending the use of the firms, Defense Secretary Tome King issued an alert for all military bases in Britain.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The attack is the latest in a series of deadly attacks against British bases in the last 20 years.</a>
