<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>On Tuesday, April 24, 1990, shuttle Discovery carried the 12.5-ton Hubble Space Telescope 380 miles into space.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Once in orbit above Earth's distorting atmosphere, Hubble would be able to see 10 times better than the largest Earth telescopes.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Wednesday it was lifted into space by Discovery's mechanical arm and released into orbit.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Friday the 94.5-inch mirror was exposed to starlight.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Saturday controllers took Hubble out of safe mode.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Problems with a solar power array, communications antennas, and two position- stabilizing gyroscopes -- exacerbated by conservative limits set on systems -- put Hubble several days behind schedule and delayed transmittal of the first photograph.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Discovery's astronauts -- Shriver, Bolden, Hawley, McCandless, and Sullivan - - were all veterans of previous flights.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The shuttle followed Hubble for two days to assist if necessary.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A seven- month checkout period would follow.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Spacelab Astro was to be put up two weeks later to give Hubble additional target information.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Hubble, delayed since 1983, cost $1.5 billion.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Spare parts, training, and software cost $500 million more.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Maintenance cost $7 million a month on Earth and will cost $200 million yearly in orbit, for Hubble's 15-year lifetime.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Discovery carried the Hooker Telescope eyepiece used by astronomer Edwin Hubble, for whom the Hubble is named.</a>
