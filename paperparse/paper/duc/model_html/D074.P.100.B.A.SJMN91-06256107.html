<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Frustrated Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee complain that Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas is an evasive witness, but there has been no groundswell of opposition to his confirmation.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Several Senators were skeptical of Thomas's insistence that he has no opinion on the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Senators criticized Thomas's tendency to back away from comments made in past speeches or articles giving, as one put it, the "appearance of a confirmation conversion".</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>5 of the 14 committee members, all Republicans, appear solidly for Thomas, probably 6 Democrats are opposed, and three swing votes, one Republican, two Democrats, could go either way.</a>
