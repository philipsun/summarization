<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Doctors should be cautious in prescribing aspirin to prevent heart attacks until more research supports its value.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Studies do indicate that aspirin reduces the risk of first non- fatal heart attacks, by reducing the ability of blood platelets to form clots.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>But for people who have clotting problems or have high blood pressure aspirin may increase the risk for hemorrhagic stroke.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In one study, there were 10 hemorrhagic strokes recorded among the 11,000 subjects taking aspirin, compared with 2 strokes in the 11,000 taking a substitute.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Overall death rates for the two groups were similar, though the aspirin non-fatal heart attack rate was much lower.</a>
