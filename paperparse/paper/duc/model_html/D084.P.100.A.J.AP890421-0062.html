<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Retired Adm. Eugene LaRocque of the Center for Defense Information said Thursday that the 16-inch guns on the Iowa, which can fire a 2,700 pound shell a distance of 20 miles are "old-fashioned and inherently dangerous".</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The main criticism is that six 110- pound silk bags of gunpowder are required to fire the projectile.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Hot debris may remain or explosive gases can build up in the barrel, igniting powder before the breech is closed.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Capt. Larry Seaquist, former commander of the Iowa, defended the gun, saying it is "[the] finest naval gun in the world and it is still a front-line system".</a>
