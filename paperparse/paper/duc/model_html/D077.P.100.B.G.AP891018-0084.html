<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The greater the quake, the more stress it relieves and, thus, the longer it takes for the same size quake to occur again.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In the face of conflicting evidence, the US Geological Survey issued a 1988 report that concluded the 1906 quake didn't release as much stress in the San Francisco region as believed.</a>
