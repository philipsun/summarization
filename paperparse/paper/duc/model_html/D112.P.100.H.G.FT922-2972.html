<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>About 20 banks were concerned last summer at the behavior of businesses run by Robert Maxwell before his empire collapsed.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Although concerned about the impact of late payments, the banks did not discuss those concerns with each other.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The banks were involved in a flurry of foreign exchange deals in which the Maxwell Communications Corporation (MCC) would buy currency in one financial center while promising to make payment in another center.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Several times, MCC received the currency but didn't make the payment, thereby giving themselves an unauthorized loan.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Last year, MCC made many repayments to banks by looting pension fund assets.</a>
