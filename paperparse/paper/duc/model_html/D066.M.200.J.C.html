<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Sam Walton died in April 1992, shortly after his 74th birthday on 29 March.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>He rose from humble beginnings to become the country's richest man.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>He accomplished this by dint of hard work, an engaging personality and willingness to defy accepted retailing practices.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>After earning a college degree and serving in the army, he opened a Ben Franklin franchise in Arkansas.</a>
