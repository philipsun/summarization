<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The shuttle Discovery soared into space to launch its history-making payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>While orbiting at 380 statute miles above Earth, it will provide astronomers worldwide with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The telescope's release from the shuttle Discovery was delayed because a solar power panel took three tries before it fully unfurled.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Once released, ground controllers were unable to link up the telescope's two high-gain antennas with their assigned relay satellite.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, scientists, optimistic that the Hubble will soon be operational, authorized the shuttle Discovery crew to return home.</a>
