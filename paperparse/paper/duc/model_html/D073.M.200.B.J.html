<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Since roaring to life about two weeks ago, explosions at Mount Pinatubo, located 10 miles from Clark AFB in the Philippines, have become increasingly severe.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The first eruptions shot gas, steam and ash 12,000 feet above the mountain.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Today's eruptions spewed matter over 12 miles high, and a possible lava flow was seen for the first time.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Clark, evacuated nearly a week ago, is covered in ash, as is Subic Bay naval base, which received the 16,000 Clark evacuees.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>U.S. officials, while not commenting on whether nuclear weapons are at the abandoned base, denied the possibility of radioactive contamination if molten rock hits the weapons depots.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>At least four deaths and 24 people injured have been recorded since Pinatubo began erupting after six centuries of dormancy.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>About 84,000 have been evacuated.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Heavy rains today have raised fears of catastrophic mudflows.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Pinatubo is in the "Ring of Fire" that circles the Pacific.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Mount Unzen in Japan, also in the ring, recently erupted, killing 38.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>President Aquino toured refugee centers and authorized the release of $1.42 million for relief efforts.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>According to Foreign Secretary Manglapus, the eruptions should not effect the stalled talks with the U.S. on new Clark and Subic lease agreements.</a>
