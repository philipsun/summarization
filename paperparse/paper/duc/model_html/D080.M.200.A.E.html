<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The McMartin Pre-School child molestation case, the longest and costliest criminal trial in U.S. history ended with the acquittal of Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 charges.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A decision has yet to be reached on whether to retry Buckey on the 13 charges on which the jury deadlocked.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The case originally involved Buckey and his mother, as well as his sister and grandmother and three other employees of the school.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The charges against the sister, grandmother and the three employees were dropped for lack of evidence.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In reaching their verdict, the jury said that the videotaped interviews of the child were a factor in finding the Buckeys innocent.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The jurors felt the interviewers asked leading questions and never allowed the children to tell their own story.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A number of the jurors stated that they believed some of the children had been molested but that the prosecution had not proven that Raymond Buckey was responsible.</a>
