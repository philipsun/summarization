<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Biographer Edward Behr released information Wednesday about his BBC documentary on Hirohito.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>President Truman, the show claims, decided not to prosecute Hirohito for war crimes, and Japan's wartime prime minister, Gen.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Tojo, was pressured into changing his testimony so the emperor would not be incriminated.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The show also challenges the theory that Hirohito was forced to accept his generals' plans, alleging that he knew about the 1937 massacre of over 20,000 Chinese at Nanking and had advance knowledge of the Pearl Harbor attack.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>BBC will show the documentary on Jan 24.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It will air in the United States in March.</a>
