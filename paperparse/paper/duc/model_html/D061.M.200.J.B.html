<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Tropical Storm Gilbert strengthened into an eastern Caribbean hurricane on Saturday night, September 10, 1988.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Government officials of the island nations in its westerly path issued alerts, warnings and orders to evacuate their southerly-exposed coastal areas.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican escaped with only some coastal flooding and a few deaths before Gilbert continued on to strike Jamaica with 110mph winds and torrential rains.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The storm, now one of the largest systems seen in the Caribbean for a long time, slowly traversed the length of the island causing massive damage and nineteen deaths.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes were destroyed leaving 500,000 people homeless.</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Cuba and our American military bases there both avoided the brunt of the storm before it slammed full force into the Yucatan Peninsula.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>By now Gilbert had strengthened into the most severe hurricane ever recorded with barometric pressure of 26.31 inches and sustained winds of 179mph, gusting to 218mph.</a>
