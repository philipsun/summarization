<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A study found that if heart attack victims quickly receive clot-dissolving drugs, they usually don't need the extra step of a common balloon procedure, known as angioplasty.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The clot-dissolving factor known as TPA, dramatically improved the survival chances of heart attack victims.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>When groups who underwent angioplasty were compared to groups who received TPA and only those with lingering heart pain or other symptoms underwent angioplasty, there was no difference in survival rates.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The results mean that most patients can be treated in community hospitals where angioplasty is not available and that the nation could save $704 million in medical bills.</a>
