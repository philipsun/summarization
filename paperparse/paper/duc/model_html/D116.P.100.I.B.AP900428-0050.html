<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The Hubble had been on "safe mode" with all motion stopped because of earlier problems in linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite.</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>It is now on a "normal control-all mode" where its own computers and sensors guide it.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Hubble's systems were set at conservative limits for initial operations and that caused many malfunctions.</a>
