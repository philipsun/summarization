<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee endorsed the nomination of Republican activist Peter Secchia to be ambassador to Italy.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The chairman, Senator Pell, had many misgivings about the nomination but did not vote against Secchia.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Secchia pledged to be more careful in his use of language as a diplomat that he had used as an activist.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Pell was not convinced.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>He said that the nomination was a mistake and that "in all likelihood Mr. Secchia will be an embarrassment to the administration and the United States".</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>However, since Secchia is the president's choice he would not try to block it.</a>
