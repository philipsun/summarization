<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Prime Minister John Major won the general election a year ago, but today he is a deeply unpopular, unproven leader.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>His party is internally torn over the controversy that accompanied Britain's withdrawal of sterling from the European Monetary System and by a lingering deep recession that has alienated many traditional supporters in business.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Most industrialists are grateful that he won the election and he is appreciated for personal qualities that are favorably compared to those of his predecessor.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Unlike the former prime minister, however, he is viewed as a weak leader, with little vision and no clearly articulated political conviction.</a>
