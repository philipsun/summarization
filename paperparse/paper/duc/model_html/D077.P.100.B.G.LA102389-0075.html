<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The cities of Charleston, SC and San Francisco have similarities and differences when they were the scenes of two back-to-back disasters: Hurricane Hugo and the Bay Area earthquake.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Charleston had warning but San Francisco did not.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Charleston's neighborhoods were littered with debris, 80% of the buildings were damaged, and power was out.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>San Francisco's streets were passable within a day and power was restored overnight.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Charleston, however, in contrast to San Francisco, could quickly assess structural damage and it lost no major economic area such as the Bay Bridge.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Both have experienced delays in disaster relief from the federal government.</a>
