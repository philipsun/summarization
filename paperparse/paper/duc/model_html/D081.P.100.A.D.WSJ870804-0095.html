<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The National Union of Mineworkers said an estimated 200,000 gold and coal miners in South Africa will begin a strike for higher wages and better working conditions in what it said would be the largest job action to ever affect the nation's mining industry.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Gold and coal account for more than half of South Africa's foreign currency earnings.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Mine owners, in anticipation of a strike, have been building stockpiles and do not expect the strike to have much impact unless it lasts over a month.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Other mines, such as diamond mines, may go on strike if the current striking miners' demands are not met.</a>
