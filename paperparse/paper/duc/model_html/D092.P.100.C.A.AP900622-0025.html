<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The earthquake that struck northern Iran on Thursday killing about 25,000 people registered 7.7 on the Richter scale.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Many of the victims lived in fragile homes built of a ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily and the quake occurred just after midnight, so most people were inside asleep when it hit.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It occurred in an area of Iran where most of the buildings are on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts and allows structures to collapse.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The quake of 7.7 magnitude was the largest ever recorded in that area where two major plates of the earth's crust meet.</a>
